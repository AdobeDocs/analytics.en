| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
|Expiration of allowlist EOL extension for legacy Analytics OAuth/JWT integrations | January 14, 2022 | On **May 25, 2022**, the [Analytics 1.3 API, 1.4 SOAP API, and Legacy Analytics OAuth/JWT EOL](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/APIEOL.md) allowlist extension will expire. It was offered to provide customers using legacy [!DNL Adobe Analytics] OAuth/JWT credentials additional time to migrate their client integrations to [Adobe IMS credentials](https://developer.adobe.com/console). This expiration affects (but is not limited to) [!DNL Adobe Analytics Livestream] and [!DNL Adobe Campaign] customers who have not completed their required IMS migrations. Customers who are currently using legacy [!DNL Analytics] OAuth/JWT credentials via the allowlist extension and who do not complete their migration to IMS credentials by May 25, 2022 will lose access to Adobe services. Livestream customers can refer to these [instructions](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/live-stream-api/getting_started.md) on migrating their client applications to IMS credentials.

Since the release of Analysis Workspace in 2015, [!DNL Reports & Analytics] functionality and capabilities have been moved to Analysis Workspace and a threshold of workflow parity has been reached. [This notice](https://spark.adobe.com/page/6WnF8JK6IRDhf/) explains the end-of-life process. |

### Important notices for [!DNL Analytics] administrators {#aa-notices-feb22}

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Older scheduled reports paused  | March 11, 2022 | Effective **April 15, 2022**, Adobe intends to pause all scheduled reports that have a creation date greater than two years (created before January 31, 2020). No reports or data will be deleted. Only reports identified as older than two years will be paused, and no additional scheduled reports will be sent. [Learn more](/help/analyze/reports-analytics/scheduled-reports-eol.md) |
| 2022 ISO region updates | March 11, 2021 | Adobe will perform 2022 ISO region updates on **June 10, 2022**. Expect to see minor updates following this release. |
| Changing how Analytics handles A4T data collected via Experience Edge | February 25, 2022 | On **March 7th, 2022**, we will change how we handle some Target-related data sent to Adobe Analytics via Experience Edge. When using the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK with Analytics and Target, some personalization events were counted in [!DNL Adobe Analytics] as [!UICONTROL Page Views]. This led to inflated page view counts and additional server calls. With the change, personalization calls with no Analytics content will be disregarded. Personalization calls with A4T data will record the A4T data, but will not be recorded as billable server calls, nor will it impact page views or link event metrics. |
| Pausing older scheduled Report Builder tasks | February 24, 2022 | **Effective April 15, 2022**, Adobe intends to pause all scheduled Report Builder tasks that were created more than two years ago. Specifically, this pause applies to any tasks created before January 31, 2020. No tasks, workbooks or data will be deleted. However, tasks identified as older than two years will be paused, and no additional scheduled tasks will be sent. [Learn more](/help/analyze/report-builder/r-arb-scheduled-reports.md) |
