## Date range from cell

## Exclude today

Choose the **Exclude today** option to exclude today from a selected date range. Choosing to include today may pull incomplete data for today.

When selected, the **Exclude today** option excludes the current day from all date range modes including calendar, rolling dates, or custom expressions.

## Valid date ranges

The following list describe valid date range formats.

- The start and end dates must be in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD

- The start date must be earlier to or equal to the end date. Both dates can be set to the future.

- When using rolling dates, the start date must be today or in the past. It must be in the past if **Exclude today** is checked.

- You can create a static date range set for the future. For example, you may need to set a future date for a marketing campaign launch next week. This option creates a workbook monitoring for a campaign ahead of time.

## Change the date range

You can edit the date range of an existing data block by selecting Edit data block in the COMMANDS panel or by selecting the date range link in the QUICK EDIT panel.

**Edit data block** — Allows you to edit multiple data block parameters, including date range, for a single data block.

**Quick Edit: Date range** — Allows you to edit the date range of one or more data blocks.

To edit the date range from the QUICK EDIT panel

1. Select cells within one or more data blocks in a worksheet.

1. Click the **Date range** link in the QUICK EDIT panel.

1. Select the date range using any of the date selection options.

Report Builder applies the new date range to all data blocks in the selection.
