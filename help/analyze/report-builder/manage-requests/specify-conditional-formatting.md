# Specify conditional formatting

After creating reports with embedded requests, you can apply conditional formatting to cells of the workbook.

On the report builder Toolbar, click **[!UICONTROL Format]**.

Conditional formatting lets you identify cells that contain results or values that you want to monitor. For example, you can apply red shading (or highlighting) to a particular cell if the revenue is below expectations, and blue shading if revenue exceeds amounts that you forecast. If a change in date ranges for requests removes conditions that cause conditional formatting to apply to cell values, the formats that highlight that condition are disabled temporarily. While the conditional formats you specify result in no change in display of cell format, because no conditions are met, they continue to be applied to cells until you remove them.

For security reasons, macros you write for the workbook using Excel's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) language are disabled.

> [!NOTE] Conditional formatting is an Excel feature. For information about creating formatting rules, see the Excel documentation.
