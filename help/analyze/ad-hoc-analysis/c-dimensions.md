# Dimensions

Dimensions are descriptions or characteristics of metric data that can be viewed, broken down, and compared in a report. They are non-numeric values and dates that correlate, sub-relate, or are a classification of the original report type metric.

Examples of dimensions include:

* Page, page names 
* Products 
* Gender 
* Month 
* Age 
* Day, week, month, etc.
* Loyalty 
* Monitor resolution 
* Custom eVars and s.prop values

**[!UICONTROL Dimensions] Pane**

The [!UICONTROL Dimension] pane lists and organizes all the product dimensions from your marketing reports and analytics implementation. You can base reports on any dimension item. You can break down dimensions by other dimensions to analyze and compare nearly anything.

In the [!UICONTROL Dimensions] pane, you can search for dimensions and drag them to the [!UICONTROL Table Builder] or the report detail table.

You can sort them based on the following categories:
