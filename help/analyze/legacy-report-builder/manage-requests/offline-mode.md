# Offline mode for creating and editing requests

{{legacy-arb}}

Offline mode returns placeholder data to speed up the process of creating and editing requests.

When you create or edit a new request, Report API calls are made to retrieve the response. Sometimes these calls slow down the request creation process because you have to wait for the data to return before going to the next step. Offline mode returns placeholder data only and API are not made.

To enable offline mode

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Options]** in the Report Builder menu.

1. Check the checkbox next to **[!UICONTROL Turn on offline mode for creating and editing requests]**.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Display Metric Data as]** field, enter the placeholder data that you want returned in your request. For example, enter "1".
1. Click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.
1. Create and run your request in offline mode using the Request Wizard. The following screenshot shows an example of a request with "1" as the placeholder data.
