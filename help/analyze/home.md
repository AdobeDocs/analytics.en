# Analytics Tools Guide

![Banner](../../assets/doc_banner_analyze.png)

This guide features all the analysis tools you can use in Adobe Analytics.

* **Analysis Workspace:** The foremost feature in Adobe Analytics. Workspace provides a canvas where you can drag components to meet reporting needs.
* **Activity Map:** A browser plug-in that displays an overlay on your site showing which elements were clicked the most.
* **Ad Hoc Analysis:** A standalone Java application with robust reporting capabilities. This tool is no longer updated, and will eventually be sunset in the future.
* **Reporting API:** Make report queries directly to Adobe's servers, and get responses for use in your own customer reporting tools.
* **Report Builder:** An Excel add-in that allows you to retrieve Analytics data and place it directly into a workbook.
* **Reports & Analytics:** A tool with dozens of pre-built reports. Adobe recommends using Analysis Workspace for most reporting needs.
