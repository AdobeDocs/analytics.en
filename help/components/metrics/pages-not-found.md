# Pages not found

*This help page describes how 'Pages not found' works as a metric. See the [Pages not found](../dimensions/pages-not-found.md) dimension for more information.*

The 'Pages not found' metric shows the number of hits where the page contained an error. This metric is valuable when you want to see which pages or URLs contained error messages (such as a 404), so you can determine the cause of the error and fix it.

## How this metric is calculated

This metric counts all hits where the [`pageType`](/help/implement/vars/page-vars/pagetype.md) variable equals the value of `"errorPage"`. It is the metric equivalent of the [Pages not found](../dimensions/pages-not-found.md) dimension.
