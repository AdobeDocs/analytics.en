# Verify Cookie Space on the Domain{#verify-cookie-space-on-the-domain}

The Data Connectors integration for DFA requires you to set a cookie on the domain of the page.

 Although it is rare, some domains have reached the maximum cookie capacity for some Web browsers. To avoid affecting a visitorâ€™s browsing experience on your Web site, consult with your network operations, development team, or engineering group to verify that adding another cookie to the domain of the pages used for the DFA integration will not affect the user experience. You will also need to select a name for the cookie.
