# Convert your projects in Ad Hoc Analysis

## Convert your projects in Ad Hoc Analysis {#topic_5A55F73488704C5D8E42CDD04B5984DE}

Before you convert your projects, note the following:

* To convert projects, you must be logged in to Ad Hoc Analysis as an administrator, or as a non-administrator with permission to use Analysis Workspace.
* Since this is a one-time conversion, any further changes you make to the Ad Hoc Project/s you converted will not be reflected in Analysis Workspace. You do have the option, however, to re-convert a project.
* Any converted Ad Hoc Analysis project will continue to exist in Ad Hoc, with a parenthesis in the title that indicates that it has been converted, and how many times. Example:
