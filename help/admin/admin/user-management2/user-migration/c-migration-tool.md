# Analytics User Migration to the Adobe Admin Console{#analytics-user-migration-to-the-admin-console}

What you need to know about the Analytics user ID migration to the Adobe Admin Console in the Adobe Experience Cloud.

For general help on Adobe Admin Console topics (not related to the Analytics migration), see [Admin Console User Guide](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/administering/user-guide.html).

After you migrate, you can [manage Experience Cloud users and products](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/core-services/interface/manage-users-and-products/admin-getting-started.html) in the Adobe Admin Console.

## What is the Analytics user ID migration? {#section-adbe49aba10c4e62afa836a97894107c}

The Analytics user ID migration enables administrators to easily migrate user accounts in Analytics User Management to the Adobe Admin Console. After your users are migrated, they will have access to the solutions and core services available in the Experience Cloud. The migration is being rolled out to customers in phases.

The benefits of using the Adobe Admin Console include:

## How to notify your users about the migration {#section-f3b25f672a3a4d03b0559656fd99d20a}

You may want to pro-actively communicate this migration plan to your current users. Here is a template you can customize to send all your current Analytics users:

To email all users, navigate to **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL All admin]** > **[!UICONTROL User management]** > [Email Users](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/user-product-management/t-email-users.html).

**Subject:** Coming Soon - A new way to login to Adobe Analytics and Adobe Experience Cloud.

**Body:** Hello Adobe Analytics users!

Our company will begin migrating all Adobe Analytics accounts away from [!DNL https://my.omniture.com/login/] to Adobe Experience Cloud ([experiencecloud.adobe.com](https://experiencecloud.adobe.com/)). With this migration, your Adobe Analytics account will be upgraded to enable access to Analytics via the Adobe Experience Cloud. While the method to access Analytics will change, all your existing permissions to your report suites and tools will be preserved.

**Next steps:** We will begin to migrate users beginning on **INSERT DATE**. Watch for a welcome message with your new login addressed to the email id listed under your analytics account. If you have not setup an [Adobe ID](https://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/global/adobe-id-account-change.html) linked to your email address, you will be asked to setup an account .

Please contact your Analytics administrators if you have any questions or concerns.

Best,

Analytics Admin
