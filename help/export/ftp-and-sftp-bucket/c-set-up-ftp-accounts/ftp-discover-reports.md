# Ad Hoc Analysis delivered reports

You can set up a delivery schedule to automatically send reports to an email address or to an FTP server.

The delivery schedule can occur for a selected period. The reports are generally sent on the first day of the following period, but are not sent any later than the morning of the second day. You can modify or stop these scheduled deliveries at any time.
