# Traffic Management

The Traffic Management report by date range was deprecated with the [!DNL Reports & Analytics] deprecation. 

However, you can use Analysis Workspace to create the report. Once your report is created, save it and simply change the date range and/or the report suite as needed when you need a new report. 

1. Launch Workspace.

1. Create a new project and select the appropriate report suite.

1. Drag the **[!UICONTROL Day]** dimension to the Freeform table and use the **[!UICONTROL Occurrences]** metric.

1. Set the date range to your desired date range.
