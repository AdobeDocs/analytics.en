# Cart views

The 'Cart views' metric shows the number of times a visitor viewed their shopping cart. This metric is helpful when you want to understand the part of the conversion funnel where customers view the contents in their cart.

## How this metric is calculated

This metric counts the number of hits where `scView` exists in the [`events`](/help/implement/vars/page-vars/events/events-overview.md) variable.

See [Carts](carts.md) for a metric comparison.
