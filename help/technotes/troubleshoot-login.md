# Troubleshoot logging in to Adobe Analytics

Adobe Analytics uses Adobe ID's to authenticate with the Experience Cloud.

If you regularly access Analytics and randomly start encountering login issues, clearing your browser's cookies and cache resolves these issues most of the time.

## Access experience.adobe.com

Navigate to [experience.adobe.com](https://experience.adobe.com).

If you are unable to access this site:

* Your organization might not allow this domain through your firewall. Work with your organization's IT team to allow it. See [IPs and domains used in the Adobe Experience Cloud](https://helpx.adobe.com/analytics/kb/adobe-ip-addresses.html) for helpful information to give to your IT team.
* Check [status.adobe.com](https://status.adobe.com) to make sure that there are no availability issues.

## Authenticate using Adobe ID

Click **[!UICONTROL Sign In with an Adobe ID]**.

If you are unable to sign in:

* Double check that your email address is typed correctly.
* Click **[!UICONTROL Reset password]** and follow the prompts to reset your Adobe ID.

## Unable to access Analytics after authenticating

Click the 9-grid icon in the top right, then click Analytics.

If you do not have this option or it is greyed out, work with a product admin within your organization to make sure that you have the correct permissions to access Analytics.

## Other edge-case login issues

If none of the above steps work, determine the breadth of the login issue:

* Does the issue occur when using a different browser, or is it across all browsers?
* Does the issue occur on a different machine on the network, or is it across multiple machines?
* Try logging in using a different network, such as a mobile data connection, library, or home network. Is the issue present across networks?

If the issue is isolated within your network, work with your organization's IT team to resolve it. If it is not limited to a single network, contact Adobe Customer Care.
