# Legends

Legends provide explanatory details about the visualizations displayed within a workspace, enabling you to more fully explore the data represented in your visualizations.

 For example, color legends enable you to assess performance measures such as conversion or retention rate by providing a color map for the visualization. Similarly, metric legends display the values for standard metrics based on the selections (queries) that you make within the workspace.
