# Data Warehouse Delivered Reports

FTP delivery, in this case, is available as a part of the [!UICONTROL  Advanced Delivery Options] setup. By using FTP, you need an existing internal FTP account or an Adobe FTP account. Adobe does not automatically set up the FTP account for you through the data warehouse interface. FTP delivery should be immediate, depending on the file size and the number of reports being processed. 

For information on FTP limits and data retention, see [ FTP Limits and Data Retention](../../ftp_and_sftp_bucket/ftp_limits.md#concept_8CAA1D8F27B3411AB902520AD6C9A70E).
