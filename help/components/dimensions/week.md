# Week

The 'Week' dimension reports the week that a given metric occurred. The first dimension value is the first week in the date range, and the last dimension value is the last week in the date range. This dimension is vital for trended reports, as it allows you to see metrics over time.

## Populate this dimension with data

This dimension works out of the box for all implementations. If a report suite contains data, this dimension works.

## Dimension values

Dimension values include the date (month, day, and year) of the first day of the week.
