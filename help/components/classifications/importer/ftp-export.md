# Classification data export via FTP

The FTP option provides more flexibility in downloading data sets, including the ability to download data from multiple report suites and to download data set files larger than 50,000 data rows. Before downloading classification data via FTP, create an FTP account. 

Consider the following issues when applying data filters:

* You can use wild cards when defining the data filter. Use an asterisk `*` to match zero or more characters and a question mark `?` to match exactly one character. Use `?*` to match one or more characters.
* Typically, when applying both types of data filters to a download, only rows that match both rules are downloaded. However, the following exceptions apply:
   * If Rows with empty column = All Columns, then all columns except the column specified in the first rule are checked for emptiness. This exception ensures that the tool downloads any row with a column that matches the first rule that also has all other columns empty.
   * When downloading data rows based on empty columns, all columns except those specified in the first rule are checked for emptiness.
   * If the same column is specified for both filter rules (it is almost impossible to meet both criteria) then only rows that match the first rule are downloaded.
   * FTP exports have a 30-column limit.

ISO-8859-1 to UTF-16 converts your ISO-8859-1 encoded classifications to UTF-16 encoding.<br>**Note:** If you select to convert to UTF-16, the source encoding must match the encoding of the original upload or you may get unexpected results. We recommend encoding all uploaded files in UTF-8 without BOM. |
