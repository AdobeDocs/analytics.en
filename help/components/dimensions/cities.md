# Cities

The 'Cities' dimension reports the city where the hit originated from. This dimension is useful to help determine what the most popular cities visitors originate from when visiting your site. You could use this data to focus on local advertising in these cities, such as billboards or commercials.

## Populate this dimension with data

This dimension references lookup rules internal to Adobe. The lookup value is based on the IP address sent with the hit. Adobe partners with [Digital Element](https://www.digitalelement.com/) to maintain lookups between IP address and city. This dimension works out of the box for all implementations.

> [!TIP] If your organization follows stringent privacy regulations where [obfuscating IP address](/help/admin/admin/general-acct-settings-admin.md) isn't enough, you can request to disable geolocation data entirely. Contact Customer Care with the report suite ID, and request to turn off 'Geography' for the report suite.

## Dimension values

Dimension values include cities all over the world. Example values include `"New York (New York, United States)"`, `"Bangalore (Karnataka, India)"`, or `"London (London, United Kingdom)"`.
