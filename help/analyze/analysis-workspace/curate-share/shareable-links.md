# Create shareable links

Analysis Workspace offers many ways to share a project to your users, including the ability to get a link to a project or a specific part of a project. Users who receive a link are required to log in to Adobe Analytics before they can get to the project. 

## Get project link {#project-link} 

To share a link to the full project, go to **[!UICONTROL Share > Get project link]**. If the recipient of the link has not been assigned a [project role](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/curate-share/share-projects.html), Admins receive **[!UICONTROL Can edit]** and Non-admins receive **[!UICONTROL Can duplicate]** experiences.

## Get panel or visualization link {#panel-link} 

You can also share a link to a specific part of a project, such as a panel or individual visualization. This is sometimes referred to as intra-linking. This can be useful to draw your users’ attention to key insights within the project.  

* From any panel header, right-click **[!UICONTROL Get panel link]** 
* From any table or visualization header, right-click **[!UICONTROL Get visualization link]**

## Use links in a Table of contents {#TOC} 

One tip for leveraging the various link options is to always include a table of contents at the top of your Workspace project. In the table of contents, you can link to other relevant projects, specific panels and specific visualizations. This helps the recipient of the project to navigate more easily.
