# Use passive FTP mode

Active FTP vs. passive FTP controls how the port connections are established, and the choice has some firewall implications.

Adobe uses passive FTP, which is a more secure form of data transfer, where the flow of data is set up and initiated by the File Transfer Program (FTP) client rather than by the FTP server program. If you are having difficulty connecting to Adobe FTP, make sure you are using passive mode.
