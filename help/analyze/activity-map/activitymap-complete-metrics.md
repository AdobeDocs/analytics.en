# Complete set of metrics

Allows you to access a complete set of metrics from Adobe Analytics within the Activity Map toolbar.

Understanding the impact of link clicks on downstream user behavior allows you to more effectively optimize site content and layout to improve the customer journey. Which links are involved in conversions? As a retailer, you may want to attribute revenue or orders to specific link clicks. As a publisher, you may want to attribute time spent on site to specific link clicks.

Previous versions of Activity Map offered limited ability to add other metrics to the tool. This version supports all metrics in Adobe Analytics. For more information on Analytics standard metrics, go [here](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/metrics.html).

You can access your full set of metrics that are supported by an eVar in Adobe Analytics through the following drop-down menu in the toolbar:
