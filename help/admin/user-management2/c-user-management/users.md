>User and product management is moving to the [Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-console.html). Adobe will notify you when it is your time to migrate users. After all customers have migrated, help content for **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Admin Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL User Management]** will be retired.
