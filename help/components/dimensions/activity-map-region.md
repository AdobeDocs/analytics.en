# Activity Map Region

intro

## Populate this dimension with data

This dimension retrieves data from the [Context data variable](/help/implement/vars/page-vars/contextdata.md) `c.a.activitymap.region`. If your implementation uses [Activity Map](/help/analyze/activity-map/overview.md), this context data variable automatically collects data when links are clicked.

## Link region {#section_75BF9B9E3CE94B59ACC3D9AF63E04535}

This new attribute allows users to specify a string that is representative of the page region where the link is located.

For example, for a "Contact Us" link that is located in the menu section of the web page, the user may want to pass a "Menu" region parameter. Similarly, for a "Contact Us" link located in the footer of the web page, the region parameter may be set to "footer".

The Link Region value is not set on the link itself, but on one HTML element up the DOM HTML tree that encompasses that region.
Using Link Region has these benefits:

* It helps differentiate links with the same primary ID.
* Trending on a region is less affected by the dynamic aspect of the web page.
* Users can see the top performing links within a region. With Region as an anchor, we can show overlays of links that are not currently visible on the page (Ajax, Targeting).
* A Region can supersede pages as a given region may be used across many web pages. It helps answer questions like: "Does my "Product Offering" region perform best on the Women's Landing Page or the Men's Landing Page? 
* In itself, Region is a relevant dimension to analyze highly dynamic web pages. This is because it removes the noise due to continuously changing links: a "Latest News" Region in the CNN landing page may have a lot of changing links. But the region will always be there. So it might be interesting to trend at the Region level over many days.
