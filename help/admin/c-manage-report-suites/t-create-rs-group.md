# Create a report suite group

Steps that describe how to create a report suite group.

In the [!UICONTROL Report Suite Manager], you can organize your report suites into custom groups. Groups let you quickly access multiple report suites that share similar settings or that you commonly edit together. 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Report Suites]**.
1. In the [!UICONTROL Report Suite Groups] area, select a report suite.
1. Type a name for the report suite group.
1. Drag report suites from the [!UICONTROL Report Suite List] to the [!UICONTROL Drag Report Suites Here] area.

   Click `Ctrl+click` and `Shift+click` to select multiple report suites and drag them to the group.
