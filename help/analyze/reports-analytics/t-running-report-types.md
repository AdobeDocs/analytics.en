# Run different report types

{{ra-eol}}

Steps on running the different report types.

## Run a ranked report {#task_C570BA4A213F4F2EB7B30E012934BE7D}

In a ranked report, the table shows the rankings of the report pages in relation to the metric, according to number or percentage. Ranked reports can display multiple metrics in a report.

1. Generate a report, such as a [!UICONTROL Pages Report] ( **[!UICONTROL Reports]** > **[!UICONTROL Site Content]** > **[!UICONTROL Pages]**).
1. In the report header, click **[!UICONTROL Ranked.]**
1. To rank the report, click a column heading in the table.

   Ranked reports can have up to 200 items listed in the table (such as products, categories, web pages, and so on) and ten metrics (revenue, orders, views, and so on).

## Run a trended report {#task_F03B4E760B9E4EA29FC3F654E6316887}

Trended reports display metrics over time. You use this report type when you want to see how a segment performs from one time period to the next.

Most Conversion and Traffic reports have a Trended view available. Using the [!UICONTROL Calendar], you can show improvement for any time period breakdowns, including days of a month, weeks of a year, weeks of a quarter, months of a year, and so on. Trended reports show trends for a single metric (revenue, orders, views, and so on) for up to five items (such as products, categories, web pages, and so on).

**To run a trended report** 

1. Run a conversion or traffic report, such as **[!UICONTROL Reports]** > **[!UICONTROL Site Content]** > **[!UICONTROL Pages]**.
1. Under **[!UICONTROL Report Type]**, click **[!UICONTROL Trended.]**

## Run a Fallout report {#task_8FD97C8260464F9DA731A93DB8F80184}

The [!UICONTROL Fallout Report] shows the number of visitors who visited a pre-specified sequence of pages. It also shows conversion and fallout rates between each step.

Check out the new [Fallout Analysis](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/fallout/fallout-flow.html) panel in Analysis Workspace! 

1. In [!UICONTROL Adobe Analytics], click **[!UICONTROL Reports]** > **[!UICONTROL Paths]** > **[!UICONTROL Pages]** > **[!UICONTROL Fallout]**.
1. On the [!UICONTROL Fallout Report] page, click **[!UICONTROL Launch the Fallout Report Builder]**.

   ![Step Result](assets/fallout_add_items.png)

1. On the [!UICONTROL Define Checkpoints] page, specify the checkpoints that you want to use for the report.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Run Report]**.

   ![Step Result](assets/fallout_report.png)

## Run a Page Flow report {#task_133E8B87C3F04DA0A42D10CBA499305B}

Page Flow reports show the order in which your visitors access pages and navigate through your site. This report helps answer

Check out the [Flow visualization](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/fallout/fallout-flow.html) in Analysis Workspace!

For example, click **[!UICONTROL Reports]** > **[!UICONTROL Paths]** > **[!UICONTROL Pages]** > **[!UICONTROL Next Page Flow]**.

## Run a marketing channel report {#task_64ADED5CC75248319E06E3E029B47F78}

Marketing Channel reporting provides an overview report of the first and last-touch channel allocation, with standard reporting metrics like revenue, orders, and cost. These reports enable you to analyze how much revenue each channel generates.

See the [Marketing Channel](/help/components/c-marketing-channels/analyze-mc.md) help system for more information.

## Run an Anomaly Detection report {#task_4808C96327354D789C075823F5C3A049}

You can run [Anomaly Detection and Contribution Analysis](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/virtual-analyst/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection.html) only in Analysis Workspace.

## Run a Real-Time report {#task_5D25929C918E40B18965222FA94176B0}

Describes how to view and interpret real-time reports.

**[!UICONTROL Reports > Site Metrics > Real-Time]** .

Real-Time reporting offers two main reports - an overview report and a detail report. They each consist of a number of reportlets.

See [Real-time reporting overview](/help/components/c-real-time-reporting/realtime.md) for more information.

1. Take a look at the **[!UICONTROL Overview]** report and its components:  ![](assets/rtr_overview_report.png)

2. Click a list item in the Primary Reportlet to launch the **[!UICONTROL Details]** view for that list item:  ![](assets/rtr_detail_report.png)

   | **Item Trend Reportlet** | Presents the trend line of the item that was selected in the Overview Report for the last N minutes. N is configurable through the Time Range selector.  |
   |---|---|
   | **Item Total Reportlet** | Presents a total metric count for the item that was selected in the Overview Report for the last N minutes. N is configurable through the Time Range selector.  |
   | **Correlated Secondary 1 Reportlet** | This reportlet is very similar to the Secondary 1 Reportlet. The only difference is the data source used to populate this report: in this example, it shows the correlation (or breakdown) between a specific page (the one you selected in the primary reportlet of the Overview report) and the instances viewed.  |
   | **Correlated Secondary 2 Reportlet** | This reportlet is very similar to the Secondary 2 Reportlet. The only difference is the data source used to populate this report: in this example, it shows the correlation (or breakdown) between a specific page (the one you selected in the primary reportlet of the Overview report) and the language dimension.  |
