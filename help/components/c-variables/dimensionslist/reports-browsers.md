# Browser

Lists the browser versions used to visit your site as identified by the user agent string.

For example: 

* Google Chrome 74
* Mozilla Firefox 67
* Google Chrome 73 
* Mozilla Firefox 66
* Safari 12
* Safari 11 
* Opera 60
* Microsoft Edge 17
* Internet Explorer 11

The Browsers report might contain a browser with an unknown version.

Adobe Analytics uses a lookup table to populate the browsers report. These lookup table entries are version-specific. Therefore, when an organization (such as Mozilla)updates their browser, Analytics doesn't recognize the exact version used. When this event occurs, it specifies the general browser followed with an unknown version.
