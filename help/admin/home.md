Adobe Analytics currently has two areas for administrators:

* Adobe Admin Console: Use this area for provisioning Experience Cloud tools, and managing user permissions. It is located at [adminconsole.adobe.com](https://adminconsole.adobe.com).
* Analytics Admin Tools: Use this area for report suite and variable management. It can be accessed by clicking [!UICONTROL Admin] in the top header of Adobe Analytics.

This guide covers:

* All tasks that are done in Analytics Admin Tools. This area includes setting up report suites, variables, classifications, or data governance. See [Admin Tools](admin/c-admin-tools.md) for a list of report suite and company settings available.
* All Analytics-specific tasks that are done in the Adobe Admin Console. This area includes product provisioning and user permission management. See [Adobe Analytics in the Adobe Admin Console](admin-console/home.md) for a list of actions that can be done in the Adobe Admin Console.

This guide does not cover many of the generic capabilities that the Adobe Admin Console offers. Instead, see [Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-console.html) in the Enterprise user guide.
