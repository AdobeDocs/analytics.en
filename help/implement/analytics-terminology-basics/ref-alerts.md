# Alerts

Intelligent Alerts let you create and manage alerts in Analysis Workspace, complete with alert preview and rule contribution.

 You can

* Build alerts based on anomalies (90%, 95%, or 99% thresholds; % change; above/below). 
* Preview how often an alert will trigger. 
* Send alerts by e-mail or SMS with links to auto-generated Analysis Workspace projects. 
* Create "stacked" alerts that capture multiple metrics in a single alert.

You can access this new Alerts system from **[!UICONTROL More]** > **[!UICONTROL Alerts]** in any report in Reports & Analytics.

See [Intelligent Alerts](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/analysis-workspace/intellligent_alerts.html) in the Analysis Workspace Help.
