# state

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This variable is retired and not an available dimension in Analysis Workspace. Use the [US States](/help/components/dimensions/us-states.md) dimension instead, which AppMeasurement automatically collects based on the location of the visitor.

In previous versions of Adobe Analytics, the `state` variable was used when visitors filled out shipping information on retail sites. It is functionally identical to a prop, but is not available in Analysis Workspace.

## State using the Adobe Analytics extension

You can set state either while configuring the Analytics extension (global variables) or under rules.

1. Log in to [Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](https://experience.adobe.com/data-collection) using your AdobeID credentials.
2. Click the desired tag property.
3. Go to the [!UICONTROL Rules] tab, then click the desired rule (or create a rule).
4. Under [!UICONTROL Actions], click an existing [!UICONTROL Adobe Analytics - Set Variables] action or click the '+' icon.
5. Set the [!UICONTROL Extension] drop-down list to Adobe Analytics, and the [!UICONTROL Action Type] to [!UICONTROL Set Variables].
6. Locate the [!UICONTROL State] section.

You can set state to any string value or data element.

## s.state in AppMeasurement and the Analytics extension custom code editor

The `s.state` variable is a string that typically contains the state or province of the visitor. Full state names or two-letter codes are both valid. It has a maximum value of 50 bytes; longer values are truncated. Its default value is an empty string.

```js
s.state = "Utah";
```
