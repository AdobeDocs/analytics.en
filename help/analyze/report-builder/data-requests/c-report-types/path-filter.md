1. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Define 'Site Section Paths' Path Pattern]** dialog, you can specify
   1. the starting rank of the first report.
   1. the number of entries you want displayed in this report.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Edit]** to define a path pattern.
1. If you want a custom pattern, drag and drop any **[!UICONTROL Pattern Objects]** from the list on the left into the **[!UICONTROL Pattern Build Canvas]** on the right.

   Some of these patterns are specific to report builder: Entry Path's Next Item Pattern, Exit Path's Previous Item Pattern, Next Item Pattern.
1. To edit a predefined pattern,
   1. Select it. For example, select the **[!UICONTROL Exited Site Pattern]**: ![](assets/exited_site_pattern.png)

   1. Now you should define the site section path that the user follows before exiting. Click **[!UICONTROL Specific Item(s): 0 selected]**. You can define this path by selecting from a range of cells (if you are editing an existing request) or by selecting from a list of sections.
   1. To select from a range of cells from a previous request, select **[!UICONTROL From range of cells]** and click the cell selector icon. Then pick the cells from the report. ![](assets/choose_site_section_paths.png)

   1. To select from a list of site sections, select **[!UICONTROL From list]** and click **[!UICONTROL Add]**.
   1. Move elements from the **[!UICONTROL Available Elements]** column to the **[!UICONTROL Selected Elements]** column by selecting them and clicking the orange arrow. The click **[!UICONTROL OK]**. ![](assets/move_site_section_elements.png)

   1. To save the pattern you just established, click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
   1. Click **[!UICONTROL OK]** three times and then click **[!UICONTROL Finish]**. The filtered path request now gets generated.
