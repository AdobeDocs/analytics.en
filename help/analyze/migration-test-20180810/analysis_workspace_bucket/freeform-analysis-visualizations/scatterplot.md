# Scatterplot

The size of each data point provides a visual cue about the average number of times a viewer was exposed to an ad. The size and data vary according to the dimensions, date ranges, and filters you select.

>A table associated with a Scatterplot chart requires at least two columns. The first column defines the X axis, and the second column defines the Y axis. If there is a third column available, the Scatterplot chart uses it to determine the radius of the dot. In other words, columns*1*, *2*, and *3* map to *X*, *Y*, and *dot radius*.
