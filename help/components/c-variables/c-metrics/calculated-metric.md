# Calculated metrics

Calculated metrics enable you to combine metrics to create mathematical operations that are used as new metrics. These metrics can be created for a report to which you add metrics. Administrators can create calculated metrics for all users of a report suite.

For more information on changes to the way calculated metrics are created and managed across Adobe Analytics, refer to the [Calculated Metrics Guide](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/calcmetrics/).
