## How to Deploy

You may use one of the following three methods to deploy the getResponsiveLayout plugin.  If you use a different tag management system besides Adobe Experience Platform Launch, please consult that product's documentation on how to add plugin code to your implementation.

### Method #1. Edit the Adobe Analytics AppMeasurement file
Copy+ Paste the following code to anywhere within the Plugins section of the AppMeasurement file
```javascript
/******************************************* BEGIN CODE TO DEPLOY *******************************************/
/* Adobe Consulting Plugin: getResponsiveLayout v1.0 (No Prerequisites Required) */
var getResponsiveLayout=function(ppw,plw,tw){if(!(isNaN(ppw)||isNaN(plw)||isNaN(tw)||plw<ppw||tw<plw)){var b=window.innerWidth|| document.documentElement.clientWidth||document.body.clientWidth;return(ppw<plw&&b<=plw?b<=ppw?"phone portrait layout":"phone landscape layout":b<=plw?"phone layout":b<=tw?"tablet layout":"desktop layout")+":"+b+"x"+(window.innerHeight|| document.documentElement.clientHeight||document.body.clientHeight)}};
/******************************************** END CODE TO DEPLOY ********************************************/
```
**NOTE:** Adding the comments/version numbers of the code to the AppMeasurement file will help Adobe with troubleshooting any potential implementation issues.

### Method #2. Edit the Adobe Analytics Extension as contained within Adobe Experience Platform Launch

* Log in to [launch.adobe.com](https://launch.adobe.com) using your AdobeID credentials.
* Click on the desired property.
* Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click the [!UICONTROL Configure] button under the Adobe Analytics extension.
* Expand the [!UICONTROL Configure tracking using custom code] accordion, which reveals the [!UICONTROL Open Editor] button.
* Open the custom code editor and paste the plug-in code provided above into the edit window.
* Save and publish the changes to the Analytics extension.

### Method #3. Leverage the Common Analytics Plugin extension contained within Adobe Experience Platform Launch

* Log in to [launch.adobe.com](https://launch.adobe.com) using your AdobeID credentials.
* Click the desired property.
* Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click on the [!UICONTROL Catalog] button
* Install (and publish) the "Common Analytics Plugins" extension
* For any Launch Rule that you want to use the plugin in, add an [!UICONTROL action] with the following configuration:
	* Extension: Common Analytics Plugins
	* Action Type: Initialize getResponsiveLayout
* Save and publish the changes to the rule

## How to Run the Plugin
When calling the getResponsiveLayout plugin (via JavaScript), be sure to pass in the following arguments:
* **ppw** (required, integer) - Set this equal to the maximum width of pixels a browser window can have before the page switches from a phone portrait layout to a phone landscape-based layout
* **plw** (required, integer) - Set equal to the maximum width of pixels a browser window can have before the page switches from a phone landscape layout to a tablet-based layout
* **tw** (required, boolean) - Set equal to the maximum width of pixels a browser window can have before the page switches from a tablet layout to a desktop-based layout

## Returns
The getResponsiveLayout plugin returns one of the following values (depending on the browser's width and the arguments you pass into the plugin) ...
* "phone portrait layout"
* "phone landscape layout"
* "phone layout" (for sites that don't have both portrait and landscape layouts)
* "tablet layout"
* "desktop layout"
...ALONG WITH the browser's width/height dimensions (e.g. "desktop layout:1243x700")

## Cookies
The getResponsiveLayout plugin does not create or use any cookies

## Example Calls

### Example #1
If...
* Your site switches from phone portrait mode to phone landscape mode when the browser width is greater than 500 pixels
* Your site switches from phone landscape mode to tablet mode when the browser width is greater than 700 pixels
* Your site switches from tablet mode to desktop mode when the browser width is greater than 1000 pixels

...the following code will set eVar10 equal to the current responsive design layout as experience by the visitor as well as the browser's width and dimensions
```javascript
s.eVar10 = getResponsiveLayout(500, 700, 1000);
```
### Example #2
If...
* Your site has only a phone mode, a tablet mode, and a desktop mode
* Your site switches from phone mode to tablet mode when the browser width is greater than 500 pixels
* Your site switches from tablet mode to desktop mode when the browser width is greater than 1,100 pixels

...the following code will set eVar10 equal to the current responsive design layout as experience by the visitor as well as the browser's width and dimensions
```javascript
s.eVar10 = getResponsiveLayout(500, 500, 1100);
```

## s Object Replacement
The getResponsiveLayout plugin does not require AppMeasurement or any other plugins and thus does not need to be attached to the s object (or any other AppMeasurement object)
