# Searches

The recommended default metric for search engines and keywords. This metric represents instances of a click-through, and shows the page that is associated with a specific engine or keyword. Searches metric data can be reported retroactively to the beginning of the data set.

The Searches metric now includes data generated on linkTrack hits. Any hit type (page view, video view, link click, etc.) can now increment the Searches metric. This increases the accuracy of the searches metric, but also changes how the metric is calculated. Ad Hoc Analysis and Reports & Analytics now calculate this metric in the same way.
