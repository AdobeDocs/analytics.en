## November/December 2021 {#nov21}

| Feature | Description | [General Availability](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/technotes/releases.html?lang=en) - Target Date |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Minute-level date ranges in Analysis Workspace | You can apply a minute-level date range under the advanced settings of your panel calendar or when building a custom date range. If you are reporting on a date range that spans many days, start time applies to the first day and end time applies to the last day in your range. | October 18, 2021 |
| [!UICONTROL Media Playback Time Spent] | Adobe Streaming Media Playback [!UICONTROL Time Spent] provides valuable insight into viewer engagement and enables media organizations to derive deeper, more granular insights with minute-by-minute user engagement through advanced time spent analysis with day-parting capabilities. You can observe the amount of time spent viewing your media streams at a specific point in time. You can split the playback duration by different granularities, including new 5 minute, 15 minute, and 30-minute granularities.

| Analysis Workspace Left Rail Search Improvements | Left rail search 1) prioritizes exact matches above broad matches, in addition to continuing to account for component recency and relevancy. 2) It highlights matched characters to make search results more understandable. 3) It's easier to find classifications related to a dimension. 4) Finally, it supports wildcard (`*`) searching to more easily find specific components that you need. Note: Wildcard searching does not yet work at the dimension item level. | October 21, 2021 |
| Dark Theme | [Dark theme](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/user-preferences.html?lang=en#dark-theme) is available as a display option. | October 21, 2021 |

### Important notices for [!DNL Analytics] administrators

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| EOL for Reports & Analytics | January 4, 2022 | Effective **December 31, 2023**, Adobe intends to discontinue Reports & Analytics and its accompanying reports and features. The reports, visualizations and underlying technology that power Reports & Analytics no longer meet Adobe's technology standards. Most Reports & Analytics features are available within [Analysis Workspace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.html?lang=en). Since the release of Analysis Workspace in 2015, Reports & Analytics functionality and capabilities have been moved to Analysis Workspace and a threshold of workflow parity has been reached. [This notice](https://spark.adobe.com/page/6WnF8JK6IRDhf) explains the end-of-life process. |
| "Global + China" RDC Type | November 22, 2021 | "Global + China" is a new Regional Data Collection (RDC) type that simplifies routing of traffic for global customers using the [!UICONTROL China Performance Optimization Add-On Package]. In the past, you had to determine whether data should be routed to the China collection endpoint or one of the Global collection endpoints. Now you can choose this RDC **type** to let Adobe determine the optimal collection endpoint based on the geolocation of the user. |
| EOL for three Analytics API services | September 16, 2021| On **October 20, 2021**, the following Analytics Legacy API services reached their end-of-life date and were shut down. Any current integrations built using these services stopped working on that day.<ul><li>1.3 Analytics APIs</li><li>1.4 SOAP Analytics APIs</li><li>Legacy OAuth Authentication (OAuth and JWT)</li></ul>Adobe has provided a [Legacy API EOL FAQ](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/APIEOL.md?mv=email) to help answer your questions and provide guidance on how to proceed. API integrations that employ these services can migrate to the [1.4 Analytics REST APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis?mv=email) or the [2.0 Analytics APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis?mv=email). Legacy OAuth accounts can migrate to an [Adobe I/O](https://developer.adobe.com/console) Analytics integration account, which can be used to access both the 1.4 Analytics APIs and 2.0 Analytics APIs. |
| EOL for Full Processing in Data Sources | October 18, 2021 | On **January 31, 2022**, Adobe will end of life Full Processing, which enables users to ingest offline hit data into Analytics.
