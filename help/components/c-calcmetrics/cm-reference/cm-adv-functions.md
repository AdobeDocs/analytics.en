# Reference: advanced functions

Access these functions by checking **[!UICONTROL Show Advanced]** in the **[!UICONTROL Functions]** drop-down list.

## Table Functions versus Row Functions {#section_8977BE40A47E4ED79EB543A9703A4905}

A table function is one where the output is the same for every row of the table. A row function is one where the output is different for every row of the table.

## What does the Include-Zeros parameter mean? {#section_C7A2B05929584C65B308FD372CB8E8E3}

It tells whether to include zeros in the computation. Sometimes zero means "nothing", but sometimes it's important.

For example, if you have a Revenue metric, and then add a Page Views metric to the report, there are suddenly more rows for your revenue which are all zero. You probably don't want this to affect any MEAN, MIN, QUARTILE, etc. calculations that you have on the revenue column. In this case, you would check the include-zeros parameter.

On the other hand, if you have two metrics that you are interested in, it may not be fair to say that one has a higher average or minimum because some of its rows were zeros, so you would not check the parameter to include the zeros.

## AND {#concept_E14513FE464F4491AD0D4130D4EE621C}

Returns the value of its argument. Use NOT to make sure that a value is not equal to one particular value.

> [!NOTE] 0 (zero) means False, and any other value is True.

```
AND(logical_test1,[logical_test2],...)
```

|  Argument  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  *logical_test1* | Required. Any value or expression that can be evaluated to TRUE or FALSE.  |
|  *logical_test2* | Optional. Additional conditions that you want to evaluate as TRUE or FALSE  |

## Approximate Count Distinct (dimension) {#concept_000776E4FA66461EBA79910B7558D5D7}

Returns the approximated distinct count of dimension items for the selected dimension. The function uses the HyperLogLog (HLL) method of approximating distinct counts.&nbsp; It is configured to guarantee the value is within 5% of the actual value 95% of the time.

```
Approximate Count Distinct (dimension)
```

|  Argument  |  |
|---|---|
|  *dimension* | The dimension for which you want the approximate distinct item count.  |

## Example Use Case {#section_424E3FC5092948F0A9D655F6CCBA0312}

Approximate Count Distinct (customer ID eVar) is a common use case for this function.

Definition for a new 'Approximate Customers' calculated metric:

![](assets/approx-count-distinct.png)

This is how the "Approximate Customers" metric could be used in reporting:

![](assets/approx-customers.png)

## Uniques Exceeded {#section_9C583858A9F94FF7BA054D1043194BAA}

Like Count() and RowCount(), Approximate Count Distinct() is subject to ["uniques exceeded" limits](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/metrics_uniques_high_numbers.html). If the "uniques exceeded" limit is reached within a particular month for a dimension, the value is counted as 1 dimension item.

## Comparing Count Functions {#section_440FB8FB44374459B2C6AE2DA504FC0B}

Approximate Count Distinct() is an improvement over Count() and RowCount() functions because the metric created can be used in any dimensional report to render an approximated count of items for a separate dimension. For example, a count of customer IDs used in a Mobile Device Type report.

This function will be marginally less accurate than Count() and RowCount() because it uses the HLL method, whereas Count() and RowCount() are exact counts.

## Arc Cosine (Row) {#concept_1DA3404F3DDE4C6BAF3DBDD655D79C7B}

Returns the arccosine, or inverse of the cosine, of a metric. The arccosine is the angle whose cosine is number. The returned angle is given in radians in the range 0 (zero) to pi. If you want to convert the result from radians to degrees, multiply it by 180/PI( ).

|  *metric* | The angle in radians for which you want the sine.  |

## T-Score {#concept_80D2B4CED3D0426896B2412B4FC73BF7}

Alias for Z-Score, namely the deviation from the mean divided by the standard deviation 

## T-Test {#concept_A1F78F4A765348E38DBCAD2E8F638EB5}

Performs an m-tailed t-test with t-score of col and n degrees of freedom.

The signature is `t_test( x, n, m )`. Underneath, it simply calls `m*cdf_t(-abs(x),n)`. (This is similar to the z-test function which runs `m*cdf_z(-abs(x))`.

Here, `m` is the number of tails, and `n` is the degrees of freedom. These should be numbers (constant for the whole report, i.e. not changing on a row by row basis).

`X` is the t-test statistic, and would often be a formula (e.g. zscore) based on a metric and will be evaluated on every row.

The return value is the probability of seeing the test statistic x given the degrees of freedom and number of tails.

**Examples:**

1. Use it to find outliers:

   ```
   t_test( zscore(bouncerate), row-count-1, 2)
   ```

1. Combine it with `if` to ignore very high or low bounce rates, and count visits on everything else:

   ```
   if ( t_test( z-score(bouncerate), row-count, 2) < 0.01, 0, visits )
   ```

## Tangent {#concept_C25E00CB17054263AB0460D9EF94A700}

Returns the tangent of the given angle. If the angle is in degrees, multiply the angle by PI( )/180.

```
TAN (metric)
```

|---|---|
|  *metric* | The angle in radians for which you want the tangent.  |

## Z-Score (Row) {#concept_96BEAC79476C49B899DB7E193A5E7ADD}

Returns the Z-score, or normal score, based upon a normal distribution. The Z-score is the number of standard deviations an observation is from the mean. A Z-score of 0 (zero) means the score is the same as the mean. A Z-score can be positive or negative, indicating whether it is above or below the mean and by how many standard deviations.

The equation for Z-score is:

where [!DNL x] is the raw score, [!DNL μ] is the mean of the population, and [!DNL σ] is the standard deviation of the population.

> [!NOTE] [!DNL μ] (mu) and[!DNL σ] (sigma) are automatically calculated from the metric.

## Z-Test {#concept_2A4ADD6B3AEB4A2E8465F527FAFC4C23}

Performs an n-tailed Z-test with Z-score of A.

Returns the probability that the current row could be seen by chance in the column.

> [!NOTE] Assumes that the values are normally distributed.
