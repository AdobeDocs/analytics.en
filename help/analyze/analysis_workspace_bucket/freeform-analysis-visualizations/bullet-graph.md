# Bullet graph

![](assets/bullet-image.png) 

The bullet graph features a single, primary measure (for example, current year-to-date revenue), compares that measure to one or more other measures to enrich its meaning (for example, compared to a target revenue), and displays it in the context of qualitative ranges of performance, such as high, mid, and low. You can specify goal ranges in [!UICONTROL  Visualization Settings].
