# DTM implementation overview

Use Dynamic Tag Management to manage tags and collect and distribute data across digital marketing systems. Dynamic Tag Management provides a single data layer that pushes data from multiple sources. Dynamic Tag Management also enables responsive delivery of user-specific content.

This help section provides specific information about using Dynamic Tag Management to implement Adobe Analytics. For detailed information about Dynamic Tag Management, refer to the [Dynamic Tag Management Product Documentation](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/dtm/). For information about accessing DTM and common tasks when starting to use DTM, see [Getting Started](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/dtm/get_started.html) in the Dynamic Tag Management Product Documentation.

For a detailed summary of the Dynamic Tag Management implementation steps, refer to [Deploy Adobe Analytics Using Dynamic Tag Management](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/getting-started/add-adobe-analytics-dtm-tool.html) in Getting Started with Adobe Analytics.
