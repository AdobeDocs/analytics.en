# Classification sets overview

Classification sets provide a single interface to manage classifications and rules. This workflow combines the creation of classifications in Report suite settings with the [Classification importer](/help/components/classifications/) The result is a single intuitive interface to create and manage classification data.

## Classification sets versus legacy classifications

The main difference between classification sets and legacy classifications is the relation of the classifications with a report suite. 

In legacy classifications, each classification is directly linked to a report suite. Very similar classifications (for example for a product catalog) are replicated when used across multiple report suites.

In classification sets you define subscriptions of report suites and key dimension combinations. For example, a product catalog classification that is applicable for multiple report suite you only have to define once as a classification set. And within that classification set you have multiple reports suites subscribe to that classification set.

You must be a product admin or belong to a product profile containing the permission item [!UICONTROL Report Suite Tools] > [!UICONTROL Classifications] to access **[!UICONTROL Classification sets]** from the **[!UICONTROL Components]** menu in the Adobe Analytics interface. Note that legacy classification management interfaces are available from the **[!UICONTROL Admin]** menu.

Classification sets consist of three functional areas:

* [**[!UICONTROL Classification Sets]**](manage/set-manager.md): Create, edit, and delete classification sets.
* [**[!UICONTROL Jobs]**](job-manager.md): View the status of classification set jobs.
* [**[!UICONTROL Consolidations]**](consolidations/manage.md): Combine multiple classification sets into a single classification set.

## Improvements

The backend architecture released with Classification sets contains several improvements:

* Reduced processing time (72 hours â†’ 24 hours)
* A redesigned user interface to manage classifications
* The option to use classification data in Adobe Experience Platform through the [Adobe Analytics source connector for classification data](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/sources/connectors/adobe-applications/classifications).

The backend architecture released with Classification sets also contain several changes:

* When using the browser or automated import, [!UICONTROL Overwrite on conflict] is always enabled.
* When using the browser or automated import, the option to export immediately after import is no longer supported. Exports must be initiated separately.
* The Analytics 2.0 API `GetDimensions` endpoint now returns string identifiers for classifications instead of numeric identifiers. Numeric identifiers can still be used, but Adobe recommends using the new string identifiers where possible. Numeric identifiers can be retrieved by using the `?expansion=hidden` query string parameter.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The performance of classification sets mainly depend on the number of unique key values that contain data. Adobe recommends exercising care when dealing with variables that contain large numbers of unique values. This caution especially applies when combining variables from multiple report suites and dimensions into a single classification set.

## Limitations

* Classification sets do not yet support rules. Rules functionality will be added to the classification sets interface before the legacy rule builder functionality becomes unavailable.
* There is no migration of legacy classificiation rules and configurations to classification sets. A migration utility will be added to the classification sets interface before the legacy classification functionality becomes unavailable.
