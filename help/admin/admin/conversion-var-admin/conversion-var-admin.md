# Conversion Variables (eVars)

The Custom Insight Conversion Variable (or eVar) is placed in the Adobe code on selected web pages of your site. Its primary purpose is to segment conversion success metrics in custom marketing reports. An eVar can be visit-based and function similarly to cookies. Values passed into eVar variables follow the user for a predetermined period of time.

When an eVar is set to a value for a visitor, Adobe automatically remembers that value until it expires. Any success events that a visitor encounters while the eVar value is active are counted toward the eVar value.

eVars are best used to measure cause and effect, such as:

* Which internal campaigns influenced revenue 
* Which banner ads ultimately resulted in a registration 
* The number of times an internal search was used before making an order

If traffic measurement or pathing is desired, using traffic variables is recommended.

> [!NOTE] Only a single value can be stored in an eVar in an image request. If multiple values are desired in an eVar value, we recommend that you implement [List variables (list vars)](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/implement/listN.html).

Since Linear allocation accurately distributes values only within a visit, use Linear allocation with an eVar expiration of Visit. </p> <p>Note:  Switching allocation to or from Linear prevents historical data from displaying. Mixing allocation types in the reporting interface can lead to misstated data in reports. For example, Linear allocation might divide revenue across a number of different eVar values. After changing back to Most Recent allocation, 100% of that revenue would be associated with the most recent single value. This association can lead to incorrect conclusions by users. </p> <p>To avoid the likelihood of confusion in reporting, Analytics makes the historical data unavailable to the interface. It can be viewed if you decide to change the given eVar back to the initial allocation setting, although you should not change eVar allocation settings simply to access the historical data. Adobe recommends using a new eVar when new allocation settings are desired for data already being recorded, rather than changing allocation settings on an eVar that already has a significant amount of historical data built up. </p> </td>

**Expiration**

`eVars` expire after a time period you specify. After the eVar expires, it no longer receives credit for success events. eVars can also be configured to expire on success events. For example, if you have an internal promotion that expires at the end of a visit, the internal promotion receives credit only for purchases or registrations that occur during the visit in which they were activated.

There are two ways to expire an eVar:

* You can set the eVar to expire after a specified time period or event.
* You can use force the expiration of an eVar, which is useful when repurposing a variable.

If an eVar is used in May to reflect internal promotions and expires after 21 days, and in June it is used to capture internal search keywords, then on June 1, you should force the expiration of, or reset, the variable. Doing so will help keep internal promotion values out of June's reports.

**Case Sensitivity**

eVars are case insensitive, but they are displayed in the capitalization of the first occurrence. For example, if the first instance of eVar1 is set to "Logged In," but all subsequent instances are passed as "logged in," reports always show "Logged In" as the value of the eVar.

**Counters**

While eVars are most often used to hold string values, they may also be configured to act as counters. eVars are useful as counters when you are trying to count the number of actions a user takes before an event. For example, you may use an eVar to capture the number of internal searches before purchase. Each time a visitor searches, the eVar should contain a value of '+1.' If a visitor searches four times before a purchase, you will see an instance for each total count: 1.00, 2.00, 3.00, and 4.00. However, only the 4.00 receives credit for the purchase event (Orders and Revenue Metrics). Only positive numbers are allowed as values of an eVar counter.
