# Opening visualizations

Information about opening visualizations.

Because your implementation of Data Workbench can be fully customized, it may differ from what is documented in this guide. Exact paths to each visualization are not provided in this guide.

All visualizations can be opened by right-clicking within a workspace and selecting the desired menu option.

After opening up a new workspace, you may need to click **Add** > **Temporarily Unlock.**

>[!NOTE]
>
>Visualizations cannot be imported like workspaces. When you right-click in the worktop and select **[!UICONTROL Import]**, you can import an existing workspace, but not a visualization residing outside of the workspace.

>If you attempt to import a visualization, you will receive a "not a valid workspace" error.
