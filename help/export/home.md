# Analytics Export Guide

![Banner](../../assets/doc_banner_export.png)

This guide outlines ways to get data out of Adobe Analytics. It includes:

* **Data feeds:** Receive an hourly or daily export of raw data. Every row is an individual hit, and every column is a variable. Data feeds are typically sent to [cloud destinations](/help/export/analytics-data-feed/create-feed.md).
* **Data Warehouse:** Use a request wizard to retrieve a spreadsheet output of data. Data Warehouse uses a different processing architecture to allow any number of rows and any number of unique values. Data warehouse requests are typically sent to [cloud destinations](/help/export/data-warehouse/create-request/dw-request-report-destinations.md)
* **FTP and SFTP:** FTP and SFTP are supported, but are no longer recommended. Instead, export data to cloud destinations.
