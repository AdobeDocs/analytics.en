# s.linkTrackEvents

The  variable is a comma-separated list of events that are sent with a [!UICONTROL custom], [!UICONTROL exit], or [!UICONTROL download] link.

If an event is not in *`linkTrackEvents`*, it is not sent to [!DNL Analytics], even if it is populated in the [!UICONTROL onClick] event of a link, as shown in the following example:

```js
s.linkTrackVars="events" 
s.events="event1,event2" 
s.t() // both event1 and event2 are recorded 
<a href="help.php" onClick="s=s_gi('rs1');s.tl(this,'o')">event1 is recorded</a> 
<a href="test.php" onClick="s=s_gi('rs1');s.events='event2';s.tl(this,'o')">No events are recorded</a> 

```

In the first link to [!DNL help.php], notice that the events variable retains the value that was set before the link was clicked,. This allows event1 to be sent with the custom link. In the second example, the link to [!DNL test.php], event2 is not recorded because it is not listed in *`linkTrackEvents`*.

To avoid confusion and potential problems, Adobe recommends populating *`linkTrackVars`* and *`linkTrackEvents`* in the [!UICONTROL onClick] event of a link that is used for link tracking.

The *`linkTrackEvents`* variable contains the events that should be sent with [!UICONTROL custom], [!UICONTROL download], and [!UICONTROL exit] links. This variable is only considered if *`linkTrackVars`* contains "events." 

|  Max Size  | Debugger Parameter  | Reports Populated  | Default Value  |
|---|---|---|---|
|  N/A  | N/A  | Conversion  | "None"  |

## Syntax and Possible Values

The *`linkTrackEvents`* variable is a comma-separated list of events (no spaces).

```js
s.linkTrackEvents="event1[,event2[,event3[...]]]"
```

Only event names are allowed in *`linkTrackEvents`*. These events are listed in [Events](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/implementation/analytics-basics/ref-events.html). If a space appears before or after the event name, the event can not be sent with any link image requests.

## Examples

```js
s.linkTrackEvents="purchase,event1"
```

```js
s.linkTrackEvents="scAdd,scCheckout,purchase,event14"
```

## Configuration Settings

None

## Pitfalls, Questions, and Tips

* The JavaScript file only uses *`linkTrackEvents`* if *`linkTrackVars`* contains the "events" variable. "events" should be included in *`linkTrackVars`* only when *`linkTrackEvents`* is defined.

* Beware if an event is fired on a page, and is listed in *`linkTrackEvents`*. That event is recorded again with any [!UICONTROL exit], [!UICONTROL download], or [!UICONTROL custom] links unless the events variable is reset prior to that event (in the [!UICONTROL onClick] of a link or after the call to the *`t()`* function).

* If *`linkTrackEvents`* contains spaces between event names, the events are not recorded.
