# Analytics Export Guide

![Banner](../../assets/doc_banner_export.png)

This guide outlines ways to get data out of Adobe Analytics. It includes:

* **Data feeds:** Receive an hourly or daily export of raw data. Every row is an individual hit, and every column is a variable. Data feeds are typically sent to FTP sites.
* **Data Warehouse:** Use a request wizard to retrieve a spreadsheet output of data. Data Warehouse uses a different processing architecture to allow any number of rows and any number of unique values.
