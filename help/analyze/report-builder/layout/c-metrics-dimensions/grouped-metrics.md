# Combine traffic and commerce metrics in the same request

You can now combine these two metric types in one and the same request, instead of having to create separate requests.

Traffic and commerce metrics are now displayed in the same metric category in Step 2 of the Request Wizard. Previously, these metrics were separated into a Commerce category and a Traffic category.

The new grouped category is labeled **[!UICONTROL Standard]**. .
