If the problem persists, please submit this error ID to Adobe Customer Care for further diagnosis.] | Adobe is experiencing an issue that needs to be resolved. | Try refreshing your project and if the problem persists, submit the error code to Customer Care. |
| [!UICONTROL Error 500: Failed to load page] | Issues with your local network, such as company [firewall settings](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/technotes/ip-addresses.html), are a contributing factor to this error. Additionally, Adobe may be experiencing an issue that needs to be resolved. | Try logging in again after several minutes. If the issue persists, submit the EIM instance ID code to Customer Care. |
| [!UICONTROL One of the segments or the search in this visualization contains a text search that returned too many results.] | Your segment criteria or report filter is too broad. | Narrow your search text criteria and try the request again. |
| [!UICONTROL The report suite is experiencing unusually heavy reporting. Please try again later.] | Your organization is trying to run too many concurrent requests against a specific report suite. Contributors to this error are API requests, scheduled projects, scheduled reports, scheduled alerts, and concurrent users making reporting requests. | Spread your requests and schedules for the report suite more evenly throughout the day. |
| [!UICONTROL The request is too complex.] |Your reporting request is too large and cannot be executed. Contributors to this error are timeouts due to the request's size, too many matched items in a segment or search filter, too many metrics included, incompatible dimension and metric combinations, etc. | Simplify your request by removing some columns or rows in your table, or consider splitting the table into separate requests. |
| [!UICONTROL This dimension does not currently support non-default attribution models.] | Non-default attribution is not supported for the dimension that you are using. | Replace the dimension in your table with one that is compatible with [Attribution IQ](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/attribution/overview.md). |
