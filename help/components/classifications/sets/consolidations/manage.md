# Manage classification consolidations

If you have multiple classification sets that contain similar classification data, you can consolidate them into a single classification set. When you consolidate two or more classification sets, Adobe generates a new classification set that contains all classification data from each individual classification set. Consolidations are useful when you have uploaded data to many report suites. Or when you have dimensions that contain the same classification data and would like to merge them into a single workflow. 

You must have product admin access for Adobe Analytics to see the Classification set consolidation manager.



To manage classification consolidations:

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Components]** in the main interface, then select **[!UICONTROL Classification sets]**.
1. In **[!UICONTROL Classification Sets]**, select the **[!UICONTROL Consolidations]** tab.
   

## Classification consolidations manager

The **[!UICONTROL Classification Sets - Consolidations]** manager has the following interface elements:
