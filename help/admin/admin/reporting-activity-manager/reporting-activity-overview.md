# Reporting Activity Manager overview

{{release-limited-testing}}

The [!UICONTROL Reporting Activity Manager] is available for administrators. It lets you monitor and manage reporting capacity for each report suite in your organization, and provides detailed visibility into reporting consumption to help easily diagnose and fix capacity issues during peak reporting times. 

When your organization reaches reporting request capacity and experiences a degradation in reporting performance, you can self-diagnose reporting issues without intervention from Adobe Customer Care. You can easily manage reporting queues within a single interface and immediately act​​ to improve your users' experience. 

## Benefits

Reporting Activity Manager provides the following benefits:

* Informs you in real time about your current reporting capacity across your report suites.
* Provides detailed report query information on current reporting requests, whether queued or in progress.
* Lets you optimize the reporting queue by prioritizing some and canceling other reporting requests to free up capacity. It answers questions like: is this report necessary at this time or can I cancel it in favor of more urgent reports?
* Lets you restrict future requests for a specified time period. You can restrict specific requests, or you can restrict all requests from a specific user or requests that are associated with a specific project.
