# Flow

Flow shows the most common paths users take across pages, site sections, and servers.

 **Next Flow**

The Next Flow report group has three reports: Next Page Flow, Next Section Flow, and Next Server Flow. The reports in this group show you the most common pages, site sections, and servers that a visitor accessed after accessing the page, site section, or server you specify. These reports show you the most common paths taken through your website.

**Previous Flow**

Previous Flow reports are similar to Next Flow reports, except rather than seeing where visitors went after a selected page, you see where visitors were before visiting a specified page. The controls for using the report are identical to the controls for the Next Flow reports.

For information on how Flow works in **Analysis Workspace**, see [Customer Journey - Flow](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/c-flow/flow.md).
