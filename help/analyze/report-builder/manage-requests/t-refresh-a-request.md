# Refresh a request

You refresh requests after you update them with edits, filters, or you need to view more recent data. You can select several requests in a worksheet and refresh them all at once.

If you increase a request's date range and then refresh the request, report builder adds cells to accommodate the added number of periods.

1. Create and run a request.
1. After you have changed the request, right-click the request, then choose **[!UICONTROL Refresh Request]** from the shortcut menu. (Alternatively, click in the request, then click **[!UICONTROL Refresh]** in the toolbar.)

   The system displays the [!UICONTROL Refresh Requests] form:

   **Now Date:** The date on which you want to base the refresh. Also known as the [!UICONTROL As Of] date.

   **Set to Current date on Future Refresh Actions:** Enabling this option tells report builder to always use the current date as the [!UICONTROL Now] (or [!UICONTROL As Of]) date. You can revert this setting by clicking [!UICONTROL Options] in the toolbar.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.

   When a refresh is successful, the system reports this with a green icon on the [!UICONTROL Request Manager].
