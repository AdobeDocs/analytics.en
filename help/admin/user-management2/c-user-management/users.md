# User management overview

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>User and product management is moving to the [Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-console.html). Adobe will notify you when it is your time to migrate users. After all customers have migrated, help content for **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL All admin]** > **[!UICONTROL User management]** will be retired.

Manage report users and groups on the User Management page lets you manage users and groups, and control access to reports, tools and report suites.
