# Terrain image layers

A terrain image layer displays terrain imagery of the Earth.

 [!UICONTROL Terrain image layers] are stored in the [!UICONTROL Geography] profile in a custom format. These image layers can be generated by Adobe, or the Data Workbench server can transform your user-supplied terrain imagery into terrain layers suitable for use on the globe visualization.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To work with [!UICONTROL terrain image layers], you must install the [!DNL Terrain Images.cfg] file provided by Adobe.

To define a terrain image layer, you must have the following:

* **One or more terrain image files** containing the images to be displayed on the globe. 
* **A [!DNL Terrain Images.cfg] file** that specifies the terrain image file(s) to be used for the layer(s). The [!DNL Terrain Images.cfg] file enables you to add one or more sources to create a [!UICONTROL terrain image layer]. The format of your terrain image file determines the type of source that you should add. The following table provides descriptions of the available terrain image layer sources, including the supported terrain image file formats:

**To define a terrain image layer**

1. In Data Workbench, on the **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Dataset and Profile]** tab, click the **[!UICONTROL Servers Manager]** thumbnail to open the [!UICONTROL Servers Manager] workspace. 
1. Within the [!UICONTROL Servers Manager] window, right-click the icon of the desired Data Workbench server and click **[!UICONTROL Server Files]**. 
1. In the [!UICONTROL Server Files Manager], click **[!UICONTROL Components]** to view its contents. The [!DNL Terrain Images.cfg] file is located within this directory. 
1. Right-click the check mark in the server name column for [!DNL Terrain Images.cfg], then click **[!UICONTROL Make Local]**. A check mark appears in the [!UICONTROL Temp] column for [!DNL Terrain Images.cfg]. 
1. Right-click the newly created check mark in the **[!UICONTROL Temp]** column and click **[!UICONTROL Open]** > **[!UICONTROL from the workbench]**. The [!DNL Terrain Images.cfg] window appears. 
1. In the [!UICONTROL Terrain Images] window, click **[!UICONTROL component]** to view its contents. 
1. Right-click **[!UICONTROL Sources]** > **[!UICONTROL Add new]** and choose one of the following source types:

    * **[!UICONTROL Raw unprojected bitmap]**. (Once added, this source type is labeled RawTerrainSource in the [!UICONTROL Terrain Images] window.) 
    
    * **[!UICONTROL General image, unprojected]**. (Once added, this source type is labeled [!UICONTROL GDALTerrainSource] in the [!UICONTROL Terrain Images] window.) 
    
    * **[!UICONTROL Image with embedded projection]**. (Once added, this source type is labeled [!UICONTROL GDALTerrainSource] in the [!UICONTROL Terrain Images] window.)

1. Edit the parameters for the source as necessary using the following sample file and table of parameters as guides.
