# Configure a real-time request

To configure real-time request dates:

1. Ensure that real-time reporting is enabled in the [Admin Tools](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/admin-tools/real-time-reports/t-realtime-admin.html) in marketing reports & analytics.
1. On the [!UICONTROL Request Wizard: Step 1], click **[!UICONTROL Real-Time Report]** > **[!UICONTROL `<report type>`]**

   For example, select a Traffic Report. When you select a real-time report type, the [!UICONTROL Select Time Range] options display.

1. Select a time range in minutes or hours.

   Real-time reporting is available only for the last 20 hours. For granularity, you have options of selecting from 1 minute granularity to 30 minutes.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]** and continue [configuring the request layout](/help/analyze/report-builder/layout/layout.md).
