# Privacy Reporting Variables

To provide additional assistance in managing privacy data, a set of reserved variables are available to be used in conjunction with specific context data variables.
These privacy reporting variables provide an easy-to-use framework for capturing the privacy status on each analytics hit.

## Variables

* Consent Management Opt-Out
   * Reserved Variable: List Prop
   * Type: Comma-delimited string
   * Contains:
      * `contextData.['cm.ssf']=1` displayed as SSF
      * `contextData.['opt.dmp']=N` displayed as DMP
      * `contextData.['opt.sell']=N` displayed as SELL

* Consent Management Opt-In
   * Reserved Variable: List Prop
   * Type: Comma-delimited string
   * Contains:
      * `contextData.['opt.dmp']=Y` displayed as DMP
      * `contextData.['opt.sell']=Y` displayed as SELL

## Reporting

You can enable the Privacy Reporting Variables through a new Privacy setting available within the Analytics Admin Console.

Each report suite can be configured as follows:
1. In Reports & Analytics click **[!UICONTROL Admin > Report Suites]**.
1. Select the report suite(s) where you are collecting media data and click **[!UICONTROL Edit Settings > Privacy Management]**.

## Implementation

Three context data variables have been pre-defined to work with the privacy reporting management reserved variables.  It is up to each implementation engineer to determine how to manage and persist the setting of these variables.

See [Context Data Variables](https://docs.adobe.com/help/en/analytics/implementation/javascript-implementation/variables-analytics-reporting/context-data-variables.html) for general guidance on implementing context data variables.

### SSF

* Context Data: `contextData.['cm.ssf']`
* Accepted Values:
   * 1 - When sending the value "1", this indicates that Server Side Forwarding is in an opt-out state. The value "1" paired with this variable will block the sharing of this hit with Adobe Audience Manager. See [AAM ePrivacy Compliance](https://docs.adobe.com/help/en/analytics/integration/audience-analytics/audience-analytics-workflow/ssf-gdpr.html).
   * 0 - Optional. Use the value "0" for customers who consented to targeted marketing. Not setting the variable will also produce the same results.

### DMP

* Context Data: `contextData.['opt.dmp']`
* Accepted Values:  
   * N â€“ When sending the value "N", this indicates that the consumer is opting out of sharing to data management platforms.  **Note**: As of January 15, 2020, setting this variable to "N" blocks server-side sharing of this hit to AAM.
   * Y - When sending the value "Y", this indicates that the consumer is opting in to sharing to data management platforms.

### SELL

* Context Data: `contextData.['opt.sell']`
* Accepted Values:  
   * N - When sending the value "N", this indicates that the consumer is opting out of the sharing or selling of the data to third parties.
   * Y - When sending the value "Y", this indicates that the consumer is opting in to the sharing or selling of the data to third parties.
