# Segment export wizard

Export segments using the segment export wizard

The segment export wizard provides a step-by-step process to configure and export segments rather than [exporting segments from a detail table](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/insight/client/c_sgmt_expt.html).

## Export segments using the wizard {#section_B30F2699DBC7490BAD18512B91CB0CB3}

To open the wizard, right-click in a workspace and select **Admin** > **Wizards** >** Segment Export Wizard**. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Only the segments applied before opening the wizard will be captured. Also, the segment exports created from the wizard cannot spawn external commands.

1. Select the various parent levels of the dimensions and metrics to be added to your export.

   The levels displayed depend on the profile selected. You can select multiple dimension levels based on the profile.

   The CSV, TSV , Segment Export, and Segment Export With Header types need no extra configuration. However, the Profiles and Audience Export, Custom Record Service and Adobe Target Export need to be configured in Step 3. For example, see the configuration fields for the Profiles and Audience Export. Configure these export types and click **Next**.

   SFTP Export - The output file will be securely transferred to the server selected. 

1. Click **Next**

   **Note:** If the export type selected is **Profiles and Audience Export**, **Custom Record Service**, and **Adobe Target Export**, then the text will be static based on the export selected.

   **One Shot** can be set to True or False.

   **Advanced Scheduling** can be turned On or Off by clicking the Advanced Scheduling Configuration button.
