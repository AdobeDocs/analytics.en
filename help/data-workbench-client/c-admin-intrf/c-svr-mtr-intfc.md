# Server Monitor interface

The Server Monitor interface is useful for troubleshooting or simply tracking the performance parameters of Data Workbench server computers and Report computers that are clients of Data Workbench server computers.

The Server Monitor interface displays either a green dot or a red dot at its top, to the left of the computer name. A green dot indicates that the computer is functioning without issue. A red dot indicates that one or more errors have occurred on the computer.

The lower portion of the Server Monitor interface lists the processing status of each of your available profiles as well as performance details about the computer.

For more information about [!DNL Data Workbench servers], see the *Server Products Installation and Administration Guide*. For more information about [!DNL Report], see the * [!DNL Data Workbench] Report Guide*.

**To open the Server Monitor interface**

* In the Servers Manager, right-click the node of the Data Workbench server or [!DNL Report] computer. t

Click **[!UICONTROL Server Monitor]** to view details about one server, or click **[!UICONTROL Related Servers]** > **[!UICONTROL Server Monitor List]** to view details about a cluster of related servers.
