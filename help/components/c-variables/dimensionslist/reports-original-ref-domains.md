# Original Referring Domains

Displays the original referrers that produced the customers on your site. Because customers can visit your site multiple times and have a different referrer for each visit, Original Referring Domains shows how they were referred the first time they arrived at your site. This dimension references referrers only by their base domain (aol.com, yahoo.com, and so on).

You can view the number of visitors generated by an original referrer or discover how much revenue each original referrer was responsible for producing. Referrer reports can be populated each time a visitor comes to your site, even if the visitor comes to the site multiple times during a session (before the visit expires.)
