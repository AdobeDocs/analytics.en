# Customize reports

After running a report, you can customize the report to view and analyze the data according to your needs. You can filter report data, change how data is presented graphically, change date granularity, and so on.

## Create a custom company report {#company-report}

Custom reports created and saved for others in your login company to use, are called company reports. Previously created company reports and newly created company reports are listed in the Create Project modal as shown below.

To create a new Company report:

1. Build a project in Analysis Workspace to your desired state.
1. Select [!UICONTROL **Project**] > **[!UICONTROL Save as company reportâ€¦]**.
   
   ![Company report](assets/company-report.png)

1. Update the name of the report, add a description, and add any tags, then select [!UICONTROL **Save as company report**]. 

   The report is added to the Company Reports list in the Create Project modal and is available to users in your login company. 

   For more information about how users can create a project based on a company report, see "Create a project from a blank project or a report" in [Create projects](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/create-projects.md).

## Manage company reports

Admins can filter the project list to display and manage company reports. Pinned items remain pinned followed by the list of company reports that are identified by the ![report icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_FileTemplate_18_N.svg) report icon . In this view, you can delete, rename, tag, or approve one or more reports.

## Select a date or date range {#task_9BEF7D4D839A4748B76E8500D1406C34}

You can choose the time periods for your report data.

<!-- 

t_reports_select_date.xml

 -->

You can select specific days, weeks, months, or years. You can also run comparison reports.

When you open a dashboard with reportlets that have different date ranges, you can choose a new date range in the calendar. The changes apply to all reportlets in the dashboard.

To select a date range: 

1. Run a report.
1. Click the calendar icon on the top right.
1. Select a date.

   You can:

    * View days, months, or year periods (up to three).

    * Enter dates manually.
    * Click a month name to select a month.
    * Click **[!UICONTROL Select Preset]** to select a preset date.

## Compare dates {#task_95155C3700774B709F5FB81AE96B0824}

You can use the calendar to run date comparisons between ranked reports.

<!-- 

t_reports_comparing_dates.xml

 -->

You cannot compare dates between trended reports.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you want to perform a date comparison on key metrics in a dashboard, you can pull the data into [Report Builder](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/report-builder/home.html) using two separate requests. You then use custom formulas in Excel to analyze the difference between the two.

<!-- delete this procedure, but what about this entire "Compare dates" section?

To compare dates between ranked reports in Reports & analytics: 

1. Run a report.
1. Click the calendar at the top right.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Compare Dates]**.
1. Select the dates you want to use.

## Normalize report data {#task_8005B55E59BD479DA67BC618FF8BC94A}

<!-- 

t_reports_normalize.xml

 -->

After you run a report with compared dates, or for A/B comparisons, you can normalize the data to show the percent of change between the reports. The secondary data set is adjusted to compensate for differences in the number of selected days, or for different volumes of traffic.

<!-- 

t_reports_select_page.xml

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Selected Page]** link.
1. On [!UICONTROL Choose Page], select the pages you want to display.

You can view report totals on an hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis.

<!-- 

t_reports_granularity.xml

 -->

The report's time period determines which granularity options are available. For example, you can select only **[!UICONTROL Hourly]** if you have a one or two day time frame selected. You can select only **[!UICONTROL Yearly]** granularity if you have more than one year selected.
