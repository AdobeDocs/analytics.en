# Combine traffic and commerce metrics in the same request

Traffic and commerce metrics are now displayed in the same metric category in Step 2 of the Request Wizard. Previously, these metrics were separated into a Commerce category and a Traffic category. 

The new grouped category is labeled **[!UICONTROL  Standard]**. .
