# Break down dimensions

Break down dimensions and dimension items in Analysis Workspace.

Break down your data in unlimited ways for your specific needs; build queries using relevant metrics, dimensions, segments, time lines, and other analysis breakdown values. 

1. [Create a project](../../../analysis_workspace/build_workspace_project/t_freeform_project.md#task_C2C698ACC7954062A28E4784911E6CF2) with a data table.
1. In the data table, right-click a line item and select **[!UICONTROL Breakdown]** > *`<item>`*.

   You can break down metrics by dimension values or audience segments across selected time periods. You can also drill down further to a more granular level.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The number of breakdowns to show in the table is limited to 200. This limit will increase for exporting breakdowns.
