# Cart additions

The 'Cart additions' metric shows the number of times a visitor added something to their cart. This metric is helpful when you want to understand the part of the conversion funnel where customers are interested enough in a product to add it to their cart.

## How this metric is calculated

This metric counts the number of hits where `scAdd` exists in the [`events`](/help/implement/vars/page-vars/events/events-overview.md) variable.
