# Run different report types

Steps on running the different report types.


## Run a ranked report {#task_C570BA4A213F4F2EB7B30E012934BE7D}

In a ranked report, the table shows the rankings of the report pages in relation to the metric, according to number or percentage. Ranked reports can display multiple metrics in a report.

<!-- 

t_reports_ranked.xml

 -->

1. Generate a report, such as a [!UICONTROL Pages Report] ( **[!UICONTROL Reports]** > **[!UICONTROL Site Content]** > **[!UICONTROL Pages]**).
1. In the report header, click **[!UICONTROL Ranked.]**
1. To rank the report, click a column heading in the table.

   Ranked reports can have up to 200 items listed in the table (such as products, categories, web pages, and so on) and ten metrics (revenue, orders, views, and so on).

## Run a trended report {#task_F03B4E760B9E4EA29FC3F654E6316887}

Trended reports display metrics over time. You use this report type when you want to see how a segment performs from one time period to the next.

<!-- 

t_reports_trended.xml

 -->

Most Conversion and Traffic reports have a Trended view available. Using the [!UICONTROL Calendar], you can show improvement for any time period breakdowns, including days of a month, weeks of a year, weeks of a quarter, months of a year, and so on. Trended reports show trends for a single metric (revenue, orders, views, and so on) for up to five items (such as products, categories, web pages, and so on).

**To run a trended report** 

1. Run a conversion or traffic report, such as **[!UICONTROL Reports]** > **[!UICONTROL Site Content]** > **[!UICONTROL Pages]**.
1. Under **[!UICONTROL Report Type]**, click **[!UICONTROL Trended.]**

## Run a Conversion Funnel report {#task_B926A74AA6A641138C2986C1635120CB}

Conversion Funnel reports display the percentage of visitors who progressed through a set of events in order to perform a desired action. For example, you can see how many visitors progressed from visiting your web page, through adding items to a cart, and then to purchasing an item. This report also shows the number who fell out along the way.

<!-- 

t_reports_conversion_funnel.xml

 -->

To run this report, select a report, such as a Pages report ( **[!UICONTROL Reports]** > **[!UICONTROL Campaigns]** > **[!UICONTROL Tracking Code]** > **[!UICONTROL Campaign Conversion Funnel]**).

See [Conversion Reports](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/reports_conversion.html) for a description.

## Run a Fallout report {#task_8FD97C8260464F9DA731A93DB8F80184}

The [!UICONTROL Fallout Report] shows the number of visitors who visited a pre-specified sequence of pages. It also shows conversion and fallout rates between each step.

<!--

## Run a Page Flow report {#task_133E8B87C3F04DA0A42D10CBA499305B}

Page Flow reports show the order in which your visitors access pages and navigate through your site. This report helps answer

Check out the new [Flow visualization](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/analysis-workspace/flow.html) in Analysis Workspace!

Run a [Paths](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/reports_paths.html) report.

For example, click **[!UICONTROL Reports]** > **[!UICONTROL Paths]** > **[!UICONTROL Pages]** > **[!UICONTROL Next Page Flow]**.

![](assets/page_flow.png)

You read this report from left to right, beginning with the selected page. The pages that were viewed after the selected page are illustrated as a branch extending to the right.

The percentage that each subsequent page was viewed is displayed beside the name of the page. The width of the line connected to each next-page depicts this relative percentage.

**[!UICONTROL Path Views]**: Indicates the number of times a page was viewed, when constrained to the displayed paths.

For example, the Privacy Policy page could have 10,000 total page views, but only 500 of those page views occurred immediately following the Home Page. Thus, the term path view is used.

The relative percentage is depicted by the relative width of the line. By default, this report displays five 2nd-level branches and five 3rd-level branches. You can expand the number of branches to view up to ten 2nd-level branches and five 3rd-level branches. Doing so increases the height of the report and most likely requires scrolling to view the entire graph.

## Run a Funnel report {#task_2BBF6FACD48F479E8B2EE458919941CB}

You can select success events and add them to a [!UICONTROL Purchase Conversion Funnel] report or a [!UICONTROL Product Conversion Funnel] report.

<!-- 

t_reports_funnel.xml

 -->

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Reports]** > **[!UICONTROL Products]** > [Products Conversion Funnel](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/reports_conversion_funnel.html).

## Run a marketing channel report {#task_64ADED5CC75248319E06E3E029B47F78}

Marketing Channel reporting provides an overview report of the first and last-touch channel allocation, with standard reporting metrics like revenue, orders, and cost. These reports enable you to analyze how much revenue each channel generates.

<!-- 

t_reports_marketing_channel.xml

 -->

See the [Marketing Channel](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mchannel/index.html) help system for more information.

## Run an Anomaly Detection report {#task_4808C96327354D789C075823F5C3A049}

Describes how to interpret the Summary and Individual Metric charts in Anomaly Detection.

<!--

Check out the new [Anomaly Detection and Contribution Analysis](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/analysis-workspace/anomaly_detection.html) features in Analysis Workspace!

**[!UICONTROL Reports]** > **[!UICONTROL Site Metrics]** > **[!UICONTROL Anomaly Detection]** .

> [!NOTE] You can also run Anomaly Detection from within Analysis Workspace projects. [More...](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/analysis-workspace/anomaly_detection.html)

For information on setting up Anomaly Detection, refer to the [Reference Guide](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/user/index.html#Setting_up_Anomaly_Detection).

Anomaly Detection shows two types of charts: A summary chart and individual metrics charts. Individual metric charts are only shown if at least one anomaly has been detected for that metric.

## Setting up Anomaly Detection {#task_AF347B34F56E44A6AE70E019B6EB2F08}

Steps to select report suites, metrics, and training/view periods for anomaly detection.

<!-- 

t_anomaly_config.xml

 -->

You set up Anomaly Detection independently for each report suite.

1. Navigate to  **[!UICONTROL Analytics > Reports > Site Metrics > Anomaly Detection]** .
1. Select the report suite for which you want to track daily anomaly detection. To display a list of report suites, click the Report Suite selector drop-down menu.
1. To select the metrics and/or define filtered metrics, click **[!UICONTROL Edit Metrics]** at the top right of the screen:  ![](assets/metrics_icon.png).

   You can pick metrics from the list (including calculated metrics) of all metrics or from a list of tracked metrics. You can also filter on specific terms to narrow down the list. 1. Once the report has been generated, define the **[!UICONTROL Training Period]** and the **[!UICONTROL View Period]** for anomaly detection. (Think of the training period as the "learning period" for the algorithm.)

   ![](assets/view_training_periods.png)

   Keep in mind that:

* The training period ends right before the view period starts.
* The default for both is 30 days, and you can extend them to 60 or 90 days.
* Extending the training period puts your data in a larger context and may reduce the size of an anomaly.

   The Anomaly Detection metrics report refreshes every time you change a parameter.
1. (Optional) Apply segments to the report by clicking **[!UICONTROL Show Segments]** and selecting one or more existing segments or creating a new segment and applying it.

   ![](assets/ad_top_menu.png)

   See the [Analytics Segmentation Guide](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/segment/) for more information on creating and managing segments. 1. (Optional) Favorite or bookmark the report.
1. (Optional) Change the end date of the View Period. The default is yesterday.
1. You can now start interpreting the report. [Viewing Anomaly Detection charts](/help/analyze/reports-analytics/t-running-report-types.md#task_4808C96327354D789C075823F5C3A049).

## Run a Real-Time report {#task_5D25929C918E40B18965222FA94176B0}

Describes how to view and interpret real-time reports.

<!-- 

reports_realtime.xml

 -->

**[!UICONTROL Reports > Site Metrics > Real-Time]** .

Real-Time reporting offers two main reports - an overview report and a detail report. They each consist of a number of reportlets.

For information on configuring real-time reports, see the [Analytics Reference Guide](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/index.html#RealTime_Reports_Configuration).
