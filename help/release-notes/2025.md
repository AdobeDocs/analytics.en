## February 2025 {#feb25}

| Feature | Description | [Rollout starts](releases.md) | [General Availability](releases.md) |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| **Transaction ID retention period** | The Transaction ID retention period of 90 days was extended to 25 months. The `transactionID` variable uniquely identifies a transaction so the hit can tie to data uploaded through Data Sources. Learn more [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/page-vars/transactionid) and [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/import/data-sources/transactionid).|  | February 20, 2025 |
| **Data Feeds API reference** | The [reference](https://adobedocs.github.io/analytics-2.0-apis/?urls.primaryName=Data%20Feeds%20APIs) for the Data Feeds API is now available. |  |  January 30, 2025|
| **Livestream API - Client implementation** | Use the Livestream client implementation to consume Livestream data. [Learn more](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/2.0/guides/endpoints/livestream/clientcode/) |  | February 18, 2025 |
| **Update to Classifications API** | You can now remove individual classification fields or keys from the server. This provides an alternative to deleting an entire classification dataset with the DELETE method. [Learn more](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/2.0/guides/endpoints/classifications/remove-values/)|  | February 18, 2025 |
| **Update to Analytics context data field `a.locale`** | A scheduled update will change how the Analytics context data field `a.locale` is set when collecting data via Experience Edge. When data is sent to Adobe Analytics using Experience Edge, Analytics fields are populated based on a mapping of XDM fields. The mapping for `c.a.locale` references a non-standard XDM field, `xdm.environment.language`. This field will be updated to reference the correct field, `xdm.environment._dc.language`.<p>The mapping will continue to reference `xdm.environment.language` for backwards compatibility. For continuity, if both fields are set, `xdm.environment.language` will take precedence. You can view the full list of mappings from XDM to standard Analytics fields [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/implementation/aep-edge/xdm-var-mapping).  | | March 5, 2025 |
