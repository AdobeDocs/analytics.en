# About the new Adobe Report Builder

The new Javascript Report Builder Add-in that was initially available only in Customer Journey Analytics is now also being introduced in Adobe Analytics. This new version has several advantages:

- Support for Microsoft Excel on Mac, Microsoft Windows, and web browsers
- Improved user experience
- Enhanced speed
- Support for Analytics 2.0 API

For users of the Legacy Report Builder tool: you can convert your legacy workbooks to the new report builder.
Report Builder allows you to easily create, edit, and refresh custom reports using Adobe Analytics data. With Report Builder's simple and flexible drag-and-drop UI, you can create complex data queries and custom reports from Adobe Analytics data, all within Excel.

With Report Builder, you can:

- Reference existing worksheet cells to get the perfect row order, date range, or filter
- Create custom dates using calendar, cell references, or date math
- Design your tables and visualizations with familiar Excel formatting tools

## Using Legacy Report Builder and the new Report Builder together

You can use both versions of Report Builder, with the following caveats:

- Do not use both versions on the same file.
- You can convert legacy workbooks to the new Report Builder format. Rename

## Common use cases

- **Custom Reporting**: You can design and format custom reports in Excel to suit your specific reporting needs. This is especially useful for tailoring reports to different stakeholders. 

- **Ad-Hoc Analysis**: Users can quickly generate ad-hoc reports to answer specific questions or explore data trends without having to go through a lengthy report creation process. 

- **Dashboarding**: Data extracted from CJA can be used to create Excel-based dashboards and visualizations for a high-level overview of key performance indicators (KPIs).
