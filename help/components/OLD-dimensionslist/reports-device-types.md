# Device Types

Groups mobile devices into mobile phones, tablets, e-readers, gaming consoles, televisions, set-top boxes, media players and other high-level categories to let you see the distribution between mobile device types.

This dimension is also useful for defining segments for phone and tablet users by segmenting where Mobile Device Type equals "device type".

**Dynamic Device Data**

This dimension uses dynamic device data that is continually being updated as new devices are released and identified. For example, a new tablet that is released during the current month might be misidentified since it does not yet exist in the device database. When the device database is updated with the new device, any changes as a result are applied to all future reporting dates (not to historical data). Therefore, you might see slight variations on this report for historical dates over time. As a general rule, the most current report will have the most accurate data for any reporting period.

The data for this report is populated using the visitor's user agent string.

>[!Note]
>Only changes made to an existing mobile ID are retroactive. If the device is new and does not have a mobile ID yet, the only data that will be tied to this device starts on the date when an ID is added to the device database.
