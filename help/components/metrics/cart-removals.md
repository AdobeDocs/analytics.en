# Cart removals

The 'Cart removals' metric shows the number of times a visitor removed something from their cart. This metric is helpful when you want to understand the part of the conversion funnel where customers are no longer interested in a product.

## How this metric is calculated

This metric counts the number of hits where `scRemove` exists in the [`events`](/help/implement/vars/page-vars/events/events-overview.md) variable.
