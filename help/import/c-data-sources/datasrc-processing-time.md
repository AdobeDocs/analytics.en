# Data Sources processing time

Data processing time varies according to the following guidelines:

* Data for the Current Day: Processing completes approximately 1 hour 30 minutes after the data upload. 
* Data for the Previous Day: Processing completes approximately 2 hours after the data upload.

Each additional day in the upload adds approximately 1 hour to the processing time, up to a maximum of 17 hours.

For example, if you upload data for the previous day, the data will be visible in Analytics in approximately 2 hours. If you upload data for the previous month, the data will be visible in Analytics in approximately 17 hours.
