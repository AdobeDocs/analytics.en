# Use implementation plug-ins

AppMeasurement for JavaScript plug-ins are programs or functions that perform several advanced functions.

These plug-ins extend the capabilities of your JavaScript file to give you more functionality that is not available with a basic implementation. Adobe offers a number of other plug-ins as part of advanced solutions. Contact your Account Manager if you want to capture data using JavaScript but are unsure how to proceed.
