# Unlocking a workspace

Administrators can configure Data Workbench to allow only certain users to change certain workspaces.

 While a workspace is locked, users can make selections in most visualizations and sort the data in tables but cannot make other changes to the workspace.

Certain users have the ability to temporarily unlock a locked workspace using the [!UICONTROL Temporarily Unlock] option on the workspace title bar menu, make the necessary changes, then save the workspace. The next time that user opens the workspace, it is locked again.

If you cannot make and save changes to a workspace and the [!UICONTROL Temporarily Unlock] option is not available in the [!UICONTROL File] menu, this workspace has been locked by your Adobe application administrator and you cannot change it. Please contact your administrator for more information.

**To lock or unlock a workspace**

In the title bar of the workspace, click **[!UICONTROL File]** > **[!UICONTROL Temporarily Unlock]**.

>For information about configuring individual workspaces and entire tabs or folders to be locked, see [Configuring Locked Workspaces](../../c-intf-anlys-ftrs/c-config-locked-wkspc/c-config-locked-wkspc.md#concept_B6CE110BBED645D89F29373B5106836A).

To delete server workspaces, you must use the [!UICONTROL Profile Manager]. For more information, see [Deleting Files from Your Working Profile](../../c-admin-intrf/c-prof-mgr/t-del-files-wkg-prof.md#task_1E29C25E6C824CC9B51CB651E835856B).
