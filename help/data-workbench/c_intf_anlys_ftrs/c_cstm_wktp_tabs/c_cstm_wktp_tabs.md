# Customize a worktop tab

Each tab or subtab in the Worktop corresponds to a particular type of information, such as Dashboards, Activity, Acquisition, and so on.

For example, the [!UICONTROL Acquisition] tab might contain workspaces that provide data about referring domains, search engines, and campaigns.

Each tab that appears in the [!UICONTROL Worktop] corresponds to a folder in the *working profile name*\Workspaces folder within the Data Workbench installation directory. The order of the tabs in the [!UICONTROL Worktop] is controlled by the [!DNL order.txt] file in that same folder. For example, if you have an Acquisition subfolder in the Workspaces folder and then you add Acquisition as the first entry in the [!DNL order.txt] file, [!UICONTROL Acquisition] is the first tab in the [!UICONTROL Worktop] and everything in that subfolder displays in the [!UICONTROL Acquisition] tab.
