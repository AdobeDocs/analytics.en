# Segmentation Troubleshooting

## Error: "Incompatible elements in this segment" {#section_B167EE10A0844E649DD7E14D0BAEDA17}

This error occurs when you try to save a segment in the Data Warehouse folder where the segment contains elements not compatible with Data Warehouse. To resolve this error, do one of two things:

* Save the segment in a different folder 
* Remove or change the incompatible portions of the segment.

## Why does my segment return no data at all? {#section_999749CBBE984142AEA49A6E68E6730A}

Possible reasons:

* Reverse nesting - for example, nesting a Visitor container under a Visit container.
* The report does not support segmentation.
* There is no data matching the segmentation criteria.

## Why can't I see the segment I created in the Segment Manager? {#section_BE0A0930A2694A23BB32DA71696D52CE}

Possible reasons:

* Some dimensions are available only in Data Warehouse and not in the Segment Manager.
* Segment is not compatible with Reports & Analytics.
* Segment is checked only for a specific report suite.
* A shared segment might have been deleted by another user.
* Segments could not loaded due to a data center or Browser Cache issue.
* The segment has not been saved.
* IP address may be blocked at the user's end.

## Why does the Page Data shown after applying a segment seem incorrect? {#section_B226AF69FE06463A8BC5337FDA8D4949}

Possible reasons:

* Rules/Operators are incorrect for the required result.
* Incorrect application of containers to the segment.
* Traffic variables used to segment are not set properly or are expired.
