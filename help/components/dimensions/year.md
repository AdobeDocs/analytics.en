# Year

The 'Year' dimension reports the year that a given metric occurred. The first dimension item is the first year in the date range, and the last dimension item is the most recent year in the date range.

## Populate this dimension with data

This dimension works out of the box for all implementations. If a report suite contains data, this dimension works.

## Dimension items

Dimension items include a given year, with the dates included in parentheses.
