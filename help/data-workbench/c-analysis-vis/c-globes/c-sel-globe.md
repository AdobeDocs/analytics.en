# Make selections on a globe

When you make a selection on a globe from a particular layer, all of the other layers show data related to the selected data only.

 You can use multiple globes together to display different subsets of layers, side by side. See [Making Selections in Visualizations](../../c-vis/c-sel-vis/c-sel-vis.md#concept_012870EC22C7476E9AFBF3B8B2515746).
