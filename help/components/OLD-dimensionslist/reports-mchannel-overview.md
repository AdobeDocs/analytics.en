## General Properties {#section_87F54048CE5445F7A6C795C7787C530A}

* This report is solely dependent upon the Marketing Channel [processing rules](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mchannel/c_channels_rules.html). Changing these rules change how data in this report is calculated.
* The order of processing rules is crucial to how Marketing Channels work. Each hit checks criteria at the top of your processing rules first, then filters down from there.
* This report is made up of two breakdowns: the channels themselves, and their channel details. Clicking the '+' button next to each channel reveals its details.
* Only four metrics can be added to each column. However, you are not limited to the number of columns you can use.
* A small trend line can be seen at the end of the last column. This trend line can cycle between active metrics.
* In addition to various channels collected by standard methods, you can use offline data sources.
* [Classifications](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mchannel/t_classifications.html) can be used, allowing you to rename and consolidate line items.
* The following metrics can be used in this report (depending on organization and report suite settings):

    * **Click-throughs**: the number of times the *`s.campaign`* variable is defined.
    
    * [New Engagements](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mchannel/t_visitor_engagement.html): the number of visitors who have received a new First Touch Channel.
    * All standard eCommerce metrics: Revenue, Orders, Units, Carts, Cart Views, Checkouts, Cart Additions, Cart Removals.
    * All custom events: Events 1-80, and Events 81-100 if on H22 code or higher.
    * **Visits** and **Visitors**: requires Commerce Visits and Visitors, which is dependent on organization and report suite. Contact your Account Manager for additional details.
    
    * **Budget** and **Cost**: metrics specific to Marketing Channels. See [Costs and Budgets](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mchannel/c_overview_budget.html).
