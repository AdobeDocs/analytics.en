# Adobe plug-in: formatTime

{{plug-in}}

The `formatTime` plug-in allows you to take any number of seconds and present them in a bucketed format, rounded to a desired benchmark value. Adobe recommends using this plug-in if you want to capture a time value in seconds and convert it into a bucket format (such as minutes, days, or weeks). This plug-in is unnecessary if you do not want to bucket second-based values into a time-rounded format.

## Install the plug-in using the Web SDK or Web SDK extension

This plug-in is not yet supported for use within the Web SDK.

## Install the plug-in using the Adobe Analytics extension

Adobe offers an extension that allows you to use most commonly-used plug-ins with Adobe Analytics.

1. Log in to [Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](https://experience.adobe.com/data-collection) using your AdobeID credentials.
1. Click the desired tag property.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click on the [!UICONTROL Catalog] button
1. Install and publish the [!UICONTROL Common Analytics Plugins] extension
1. If you haven't already, create a rule labeled "Initialize Plug-ins" with the following configuration:
    * Condition: None
    * Event: Core â€“ Library Loaded (Page Top)
1. Add an action to the above rule with the following configuration:
    * Extension: Common Analytics Plugins
    * Action Type: Initialize formatTime
1. Save and publish the changes to the rule.

## Install the plug-in using custom code editor

If you do not want to use the Common Analytics Plugins plug-in extension, you can use the custom code editor.

1. Log in to [Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](https://experience.adobe.com/data-collection) using your AdobeID credentials.
1. Click on the desired property.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click the **[!UICONTROL Configure]** button under the Adobe Analytics extension.
1. Expand the [!UICONTROL Configure tracking using custom code] accordion, which reveals the [!UICONTROL Open Editor] button.
1. Open the custom code editor and paste the plug-in code provided below into the edit window.
1. Save and publish the changes to the Analytics extension.

## Install the plug-in using AppMeasurement

Copy and paste the following code anywhere in the AppMeasurement file after the Analytics tracking object is instantiated (using [`s_gi`](../functions/s-gi.md)). Preserving comments and version numbers of the code in your implementation helps Adobe with troubleshooting any potential issues.

```js
/******************************************* BEGIN CODE TO DEPLOY *******************************************/
/* Adobe Consulting Plugin: formatTime v2.0 */
function formatTime(ns,tf,bml){var f=ns,d=tf,e=bml;function h(b,d,c,e){if("string"!==typeof d)return!1;if("string"===typeof b)b=b.split(c||",");else if("object"!==typeof b)return!1;c=0;for(a=b.length;c<a;c++)if(1==e&&d===b[c]||d.toLowerCase()===b[c].toLowerCase())return!0;return!1}if(arguments&&"-v"===arguments[0])return{plugin:"formatTime",version:"2.0"};var b=function(){if("undefined"!==typeof window.s_c_il)for(var b=0,c;b<window.s_c_il.length;b++)if(c=window.s_c_il[b],c._c&&"s_c"===c._c)return c}();"undefined"!==typeof b&&(b.contextData.formatTime="2.0");if(!("undefined"===typeof f||isNaN(f)||0>Number(f))){b="";if("string"===typeof d&&"d"===d||("string"!==typeof d||!h("h,m,s",d))&&86400<=f){var c=86400;var g="days";b=isNaN(e)?1:c/(e*c)}else"string"===typeof d&&"h"===d||("string"!==typeof d||!h("m,s",d))&&3600<=f?(c=3600,g="hours",b=isNaN(e)?4:c/(e*c)):"string"===typeof d&&"m"===d||("string"!==typeof d||!h("s",d))&&60<=f?(c=60,g="minutes",b=isNaN(e)?2:c/(e*c)):(c=1,g="seconds",b=isNaN(e)?.2:c/e);b=Math.round(f*b/c)/b+" "+g;0===b.indexOf("1 ")&&(b=b.substring(0,b.length-1));return b}};
/******************************************** END CODE TO DEPLOY ********************************************/
```

## Use the plug-in

The `formatTime` function uses the following arguments:

* **`ns`** (required, integer): The number of seconds to convert or format
* **`tf`** (optional, string): The type of format to return the seconds in; defaults to seconds
  * Set to `"d"` if you want the time in days (rounded to the closest 1/4 day benchmark by default)
  * Set to `"h"` if you want the time in hours (rounded to the closest 1/4 hour benchmark by default)
  * Set to `"m"` if you want the time in minutes (rounded to the closest 1/2-minute benchmark by default)
  * Set to `"s"` if you want the time in seconds (rounded to the closest 5 second benchmark by default)
* **`bml`** (optional, number): The length of the rounding benchmarks. Defaults to the benchmarks listed in the `tf` argument

The function returns the number of seconds formatted using the unit you specify in the `tf` argument. If the `tf` argument is not set:

* Anything less than a minute is rounded to the closest 5 second benchmark
* Anything between a minute and an hour is rounded to the closest 1/2-minute benchmark
* Anything between an hour and a day is rounded to the closest quarter-hour benchmark
* Anything greater than a day is rounded to the closest day benchmark

## Examples

```js
// Sets eVar1 to "10.5 hours".
// 38242 seconds equals 10 hours, 37 minutes, and 22 seconds. Since the tf argument is not set, the value returned is the number of seconds converted to the nearest quarter-hour benchmark.
s.eVar1 = formatTime(38242);

// Sets eVar4 to "10.75 hours".
// 38250 seconds equals 10 hours, 37 minutes, and 30 seconds. This value rounds up to the nearest quarter hour.
s.eVar4 = formatTime(38250);

// Sets eVar9 to "637.5 minutes".
s.eVar9 = formatTime(38242, "m");

// Sets eVar14 to "640 minutes".
// The tf argument forces the returned value to minutes, while the bml argument forces the value to the nearest 20-minute increment.
s.eVar14 = formatTime(38242, "m", 20);

// Sets eVar2 to "126 seconds", the closest 2-second benchmark to 125 seconds.
s.eVar2 = formatTime(125, "s", 2);

// Sets eVar7 to "3 minutes", the closest 3-minute benchmark to 125 seconds.
s.eVar7 = formatTime(125, "m", 3);

// Sets eVar55 to "2.4 minutes, the closest 2/5-minute benchmark to 145 seconds.
s.eVar55 = formatTime(145, "m", .4);
```
