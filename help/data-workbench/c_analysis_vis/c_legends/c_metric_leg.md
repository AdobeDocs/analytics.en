# Metric legends

Metric legends enable you to see baseline metrics related to your profile and statistics related to the dataset (or to the current selection, if one has been made).

 Metric legends in your Adobe application display the metrics relevant to your dataset, as in the following [!UICONTROL Site] metric legend.

Metric legends are actually a special case of a table visualization. As such, the same features available for tables are available for metric legends. See [Tables](../../c_analysis_vis/c_tables/c_tables.md#concept_C632CB8AD9724F90AC5C294D52AE667F).

## Add a metric {#section_6655470BF06C4D2B82F7A01784552D1E}

* In the metric legend, right-click a metric name and click **[!UICONTROL Add Metric]** > *< **[!UICONTROL metric name]**>*.
