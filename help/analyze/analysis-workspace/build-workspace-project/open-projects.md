# Open projects

You can open a project directly from the [Projects](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md) page. Look for your project in the list. Use [search](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md#search) or the [segment panel](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md#segment-panel) to narrow down the list.

* Select the title of your project to open the project in Analysis Workspace.

You can also open a project while you are working in another project.

* Select **[!UICONTROL Open]** from the **[!UICONTROL Project]** menu. You see a dialog similar to the [Projects](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md) page.  Use [search](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md#search) or the [segment panel](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md#segment-panel) to narrow down the list.
* Select the title of your project to open the project in Analysis Workspace.

If you cannot find the project and want to start a new project, select **[!UICONTROL Create new]**.

## Open previous version

To open a previously saved version of a project:

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Open previous version]** from the **[!UICONTROL Project]** menu.

   ![The Previously saved project versions list and options to show All versions or Only versions with notes.](assets/open-previously-saved.png)

1. Review the list of previous versions available in the **[!UICONTROL Previously saved versions]** dialog. You can switch between **[!UICONTROL All versions]** and **[!UICONTROL Only versions with notes]**.

   For each version, the list shows a timestamp, the editor and saved notes.


1. Select a previous version and click **[!UICONTROL Load]**.
   The previous version then loads with a notification. The previous version does not become the current saved version of your project until you click **[!UICONTROL Save]**. If you navigate away from the loaded version, you see the last saved version when you once more want to open a previous version.

## Incompatible data view

When you open a project, you might see an **[!UICONTROL Incompatible data view]** warning dialog. This dialog explains that certain components within the project are not enabled in the selected data view for one of the panels in the project. 

![Incompatible](assets/incompatible-data-view.png)

To fix this warning, you can:

* **[!UICONTROL Change the data view]**. Select a proper data view from **[!UICONTROL Change data view:]** ![Data](/help/assets/icons/Data.svg). If the selected data view is valid, your project opens in Analysis Workspace.
* **[!UICONTROL Return to landing page]**. Your selected project is not opened and you can select another project.
* **[!UICONTROL Continue anyway]**. Your project opens in Analysis Workspace, but shows errors in some of the visualization and the incompatible data views have an alert ![Alert](/help/assets/icons/Alert.svg) before the name of the data view.
