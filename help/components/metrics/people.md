# People

The 'People' metric counts the number of people, or groups of devices, based on Adobe's Device Graph. It is a more accurate representation of the number of [Unique visitors](unique-visitors.md).

See the [People metric](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/device-co-op/using/data/people.html) in the Device Co-op user guide.
