# Specify conditional formatting

After you create reports with embedded requests, you can apply conditional formatting to workbook cells.

On the report builder Toolbar, click **[!UICONTROL Format]**.

Conditional formatting lets you identify cells that contain results or values that you want to monitor. For example, you can apply red shading or highlighting to a particular cell if the revenue is below expectations, and blue shading if revenue exceeds amounts that you forecast. If a change in date ranges for requests removes conditions that cause conditional formatting to apply to cell values, the formats that highlight that condition are disabled temporarily. When the conditional formats you specify result in no change because conditions are not met, the conditional formats continue to apply to cells until you remove them.

For security reasons, macros are disabled if you write the workbook macros using Excel's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) language.

>Conditional formatting is an Excel feature. For information about creating formatting rules, see the Excel documentation.
