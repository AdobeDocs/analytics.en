# Add a bookmarks

You can bookmark significant workspaces to quickly move between visualizations and reports employed in your workflow.

1. Bookmark a workspace by clicking the Bookmark icon  ![](assets/bookmark_icon.png)

   in the upper right corner of the toolbar.

   Before you have a workspace bookmarked, this icon appears as just a book. The bookmark icon changes to a book with a marked page once a workspace has been bookmarked. 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add]** > **[!UICONTROL Bookmarks Panel]** in the left pane to open a list of bookmarks.
