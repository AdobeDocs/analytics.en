# Create virtual report suites

Before you start creating virtual report suites, here are a few things to keep in mind.

* Non-Admin users cannot see the Virtual Report Suite Manager.
* Virtual report suites cannot be shared. "Sharing" is done via groups/permissions.
* In the Virtual Report Suite Manager, you can see only your own virtual report suites. You have to click "show all" to see everyone else's.

1. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Components]** > **[!UICONTROL Virtual Report Suites]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add +]**.
