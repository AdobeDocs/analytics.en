# Days Since Last Visit

Days Since Last Visit is an Analytics dimension that ships out of the box with Analysis Workspace.

It determines the number of days since a user last visited your site. If a hit starts a new visit, it checks the timestamp of the last hit (if there is one), and buckets the visit based on the number of days in the past that the previous hit occurred.

This return frequency data can be used to answer the following questions:

* How frequently do users revisit my site? 
* How does return frequency correlate with conversion? Do repeat buyers visit frequently or infrequently? 
* Do users who click through my campaigns return frequently?
