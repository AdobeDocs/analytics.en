# Calculated metrics used Marketing Channel reports

Add calculated metrics to Marketing Channel reports in Analytics.

Calculated metrics created in reports and analytics are available in the [!UICONTROL Marketing Channel] report, with first-touch and last-touch equivalents. For example, if you have created a calculated metric called Revenue per Order, that metric is available on the Marketing Channel report as *`First Touch Revenue per Order`* and *`Last Touch Revenue per Order`*.

You can create calculated metrics directly from the [!UICONTROL Marketing Channel Report]. Calculated metrics allow you to make useful comparisons between first-touch and last-touch channel metrics. For example, you can display the difference between first and last touch revenue.
