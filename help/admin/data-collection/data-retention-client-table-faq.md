# Data retention FAQ

Answers to frequently asked questions about Adobe's data retention policy for Adobe Analytics.

## Background {#section_398C549965E94A65B2EA2212056D4AFD}

The European Unionâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies as from May 25, 2018, provides that Adobe, in its role as your data processor, must take appropriate measures to assist its customers in fulfilling access, deletion, and other requests from individuals. Applying appropriate, secure, and timely deletion policies is an important part of complying with this obligation.

GDPR applies to all customers that market to or process information of EU citizens. Therefore, GDPR is a worldwide regulatory change.

As a result, Adobe would like to work with you to implement a data retention policy before GDPR takes effect on May 25, 2018.

Going forward, Adobe will begin applying data retention as currently specified in customer contracts for Adobe Analytics, unless other arrangements are made. Most Adobe Analytics contracts state that Adobe may delete data after 25 months.

   <td colname="col2"> <p> By setting your data retention period, this helps you, our customer and the data controller, prepare for regulatory requirements worldwide (specifically, in Europe, some Latin America countries, and most APAC countries) that require companies to keep data only as long as necessary to perform a service. </p> </td>

  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p><b> What is the most common contracted data retention period?</b> </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p> Most contracts state, by default, that Adobe has the right to delete data after 25 months. When this data retention policy is in place, Adobe deletes Adobe Analytics data older than 25 months, based on the timestamp of the data. </p> </td>

  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p><b>How do I decide on my data retention?</b> </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Your company, as the data controller, should identify stakeholders (such as your marketing, analytics, and privacy teams) within your organization responsible for making decisions about data retention.

   <td colname="col1"> <p> <b> What Is the data retention window?</b> </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p> The data retention policy defines a rolling data retention window in which complete data can be viewed and reported. The data retention window is determined as follows: </p> <p><span class="codeph"> start date</span> = current date - data retention period </p> <p><span class="codeph"> end date</span> = current date </p> <p> Data is included in the data retention window if the timestamp of the data is between the start date and end date.
