# Data collection query parameters

The following table lists all query string parameters Adobe uses in image requests. This information can be used when debugging using [Packet analyzers](packet-monitor.md), when [hardcoding image requests](../other/hardcoded.md), or when using [Dynamic Variables](../vars/page-vars/dynamic-variables.md).
