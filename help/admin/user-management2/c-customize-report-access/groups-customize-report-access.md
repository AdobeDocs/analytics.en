# Customize report access - overview

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>User and product management is moving to the [Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-console.html). Adobe will notify you when it is your time to migrate users. After all customers have migrated, help content for **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Admin Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL User Management]** will be retired.

Customize group permission to Analytics tools, report suite tools, metrics, and dimensions.

 **[!UICONTROL Add New Group]** > **[!UICONTROL Report Access]**

The [!UICONTROL Report Access] section on the [!UICONTROL Define User Group] page provides access categories that enable you to customize permissions at a granular level.

For example, you can create a group with access to multiple Analytics tools ( [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace], [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics], and [!UICONTROL Report Builder]), with permission to specific metrics and dimensions (including eVars), and capabilities like segment or calculated metrics creation.
