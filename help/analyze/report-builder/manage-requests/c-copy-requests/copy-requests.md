# Copy requests overview

You can copy cells mapped with more than one request and paste the content to an empty, selected region of the spreadsheet.

After you copy cells, Report Builder and Excel determine the area required to paste the minimum amount of copies. If the area is large enough, the paste creates a copy of all the requests, where each pasted request has the same spatial arrangement and formatting as in the original requests.

This is known as propagating the request. This is an easy and quick way to create a long report. Report Builder first propagates the requests by pasting all the requests in the cells for the target paste region, then refreshes the cells based on the report dates established for the requests.
