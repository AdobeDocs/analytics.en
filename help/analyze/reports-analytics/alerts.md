# Alerts

## Alerts {#concept_8AB25AF6FB52478DB98C1BA4577A2E16}

As the new alert system for all of Adobe Analytics, Intelligent Alerts let you create and manage alerts, complete with alert preview and rule contribution. You can

* Build alerts based on anomalies (90%, 95%, or 99% thresholds; % change; above/below).
* Preview how often an alert will trigger.
* Send alerts by e-mail or SMS with links to auto-generated Analysis Workspace projects.
* Create "stacked" alerts that capture multiple metrics in a single alert.

You can access this new Alerts system from **[!UICONTROL More]** > **[!UICONTROL Alerts]** in any report in Reports & Analytics.

For more information, go to the Analysis Workspace documentation on [Intelligent Alerts](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/analysis-workspace/intellligent_alerts.html).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL More]** > **[!UICONTROL Add Alert]**.
1. This will take you to the [new Alert Builder](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/analysis-workspace/alert-builder.html).

Task Context 

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Components]** > **[!UICONTROL Alerts]**. This takes you to the new [Alert Manager](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/analysis-workspace/alert-manager.html).

## Legacy Alerts Migration {#concept_7E8179F5EF6E4913B0CE5CF4FF186911}

Several features of existing Analytics alerts will not be included in the new Alert Manager, which will be released (as part of Analysis Workspace) in the Fall of 2016. The following table lists the deprecated alert features and some alert features that will be migrated to the new Alert Manager in a different form.

   <td colname="col3"> <p>In some cases, whether you create an alert on all items of a dimension report or whether you set up the alert on just the aggregated metric by itself (not applied to a dimension), the same result occurs. For example, let's say you create a monthly All Items alert on the "Revenue" metric. You would get the same result from just running the Revenue report and setting up a monthly alert on it. </p> <p>In this situation, the legacy Totals (All Items) alert will no longer be available and will be migrated to the latter, simpler version. </p> <p> </p> </td>

   <td colname="col3"> <p>In the new Alert Manager, certain time-based Unique Visitor alerts will no longer be supported.

Previously these alerts were sent on the first day of the Gregorian month (e.g. January 1st, February 1st etc). This will not work with the new Anomaly Detection feature of alerts, which takes previous months' data into account when detecting anomalies. In the future, we will add support to our scheduling system for custom calendars so that both Alerts and Scheduled Projects can be scheduled to send on the first day of the custom calendar month instead of just the first day of the Gregorian month. </p> <p> </p> </td>
