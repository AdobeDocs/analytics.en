### Add descriptions to components in Analysis Workspace (using the Data Dictionary) {#add-descriptions}

The Data Dictionary in Analysis Workspace helps both users and administrators keep track of and better understand the components in their Analytics environment. 

This includes the ability for Analytics administrators to add component descriptions (as well as modify other information) directly within Analysis Workspace. 

For information about editing a component in the data dictionary, which includes adding a description, see [Edit component entries in the Data Dictionary](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/data-dictionary/edit-entries-data-dictionary.md)
