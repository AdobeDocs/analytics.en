# Demandbase Custom Dimensions{#demandbase-custom-dimensions}

Lists optional dimension identifiers that can be given in Step 4 of the Adobe Integration wizard.

If you are unsure of the exact API ID to enter into the wizard, please consult with your Demandbase representative.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>It is strongly recommended that you do NOT include IP Address as a custom dimension. The extremely high number of unique values may cause performance issues with reporting. In addition, IP Address is already offered as a reporting option through Adobe data warehouse reporting.
