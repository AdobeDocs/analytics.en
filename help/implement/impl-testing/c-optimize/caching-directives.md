# Caching directives

The JavaScript library file is intended to be cached in the user's browser after the first time the user loads a page.

 Adobe customers should ensure that their Web servers are set up to take advantage of this functionality. For example, make sure that the NO-CACHE setting is set to false. Additionally, ensure that the expiration date is sufficiently long. Make sure any proxy caches are set up with the correct configuration. The customer's Web server documentation provides more information.
