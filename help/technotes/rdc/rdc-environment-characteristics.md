## First- or third-party cookies

Depending on your implementation, you might be using first- or third-party cookies. You can learn more about first-party cookies [here](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/whitepapers/first_party_cookies/fpcookies_overview.html).

## Secure pages

If your site contains pages that use the https protocol, you have secured pages. Most of the page views tracked by Adobe Analytics are secured using the https protocol. Secure pages require an SSL certificate for tracking. If your web property is using third-party cookies, your secure pages use an SSL certificate owned by Adobe, which allows data to be sent to our data collection servers securely without an FPSSL implementation.

## DNS changes (CNAME update)

A [CNAME](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/whitepapers/first_party_cookies/fpcookies_cname.html) update is a change made to your company's DNS server. Your IT department or network operations team typically handles this operation. If your scenario requires this change, you should contact Customer Care for the new Adobe hostname.
