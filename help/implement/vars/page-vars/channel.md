# channel

The `channel` variable typically stores the section of the site a given page is on. It is helpful to determine what groups of your site are most popular. This variable populates the 'Site Sections' dimension.

## Channel in Adobe Experience Platform Launch

You can set channel either while configuring the Analytics extension (global variables) or under rules.

1. Log in to [launch.adobe.com](https://launch.adobe.com) using your AdobeID credentials.
2. Click the desired property.
3. Go to the [!UICONTROL Rules] tab, then click the desired rule (or create a rule).
4. Under [!UICONTROL Actions], click an existing [!UICONTROL Adobe Analytics - Set Variables] action or click the '+' icon.
5. Set the [!UICONTROL Extension] dropdown to Adobe Analytics, and the [!UICONTROL Action Type] to [!UICONTROL Set Variables].
6. Locate the [!UICONTROL Channel] section.

You can set channel to any string value or data element.

## s.channel in AppMeasurement and Launch custom code editor

The `s.channel` variable is a string that typically contains the page's site section. It has a maximum value of 100 bytes; longer values are truncated.

s.channel = "Example site section";
