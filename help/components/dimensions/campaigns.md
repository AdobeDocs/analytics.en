# Campaigns

The 'Campaigns' dimension can refer to:

* A [classification](../classifications/c-classifications.md) automatically created in some report suites. It is based on the [Tracking code](tracking-code.md) dimension.
* The [Tracking code](tracking-code.md) dimension itself, which uses the [campaign](/help/implement/vars/page-vars/campaign.md) implementation variable.
