# Protected worksheet elements

If you protect your worksheet (by locking cells), you cannot create, edit, or refresh requests. Remove all protection from your worksheet before using Request Manager.

If you are refreshing the request and attempt to edit a cell during the refresh request process, an Excel error message advises you that the spreadsheet is currently protected. After the refresh request process completes, you can access the spreadsheet, and the temporary spreadsheet protection is removed.
