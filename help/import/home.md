# Analytics Import Guide



This guide explains how to get data into Analytics. It includes:

* **[Data Sources](data-sources/overview.md)**: Upload a file to a designated Adobe FTP site. Adobe retrieves the file and includes the data in your report suite.
* **[Bulk Data Insertion API](/help/import/bulk-data-insertion-api/bulk-data-insert.md)** lets you upload server call data in batches of files instead of using client-side libraries such as AppMeasurement.
* **[Data Insertion API](c-data-insertion-api/c-data-insertion-api.md)**: Send data directly to Adobe's data collection through an API.
* **[Adobe Exchange Marketplace](https://exchange.adobe.com/experiencecloud.analytics.html#product)**: Find current integrations available to enrich your Adobe Analytics report suite.
