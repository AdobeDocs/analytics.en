# Create a rollup report suite

>[!NOTE]
>
>[!DNL Reports & Analytics] is the only tool that supports rollup reports, and Adobe no longer recommends using rollups. See "[Report suite approaches](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/manage-report-suites/rollup-report-suite.html)" for alternatives.

To create a rollup report suite:

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Report Suites]**.
1. In [!UICONTROL Report Suite Groups], click **[!UICONTROL Add]** next to the **[!UICONTROL Rollups]** heading.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Create a New Rollup]** dialog box, provide the following information:

   **[!UICONTROL Report Suite ID:]** The rollup's report suite ID.

   **[!UICONTROL Report Suite Title:]** The report suite title that appears in the Site menu.

   **[!UICONTROL Time Zone:]** The time zone where data is reported.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create Rollup]**.
