# Use attribution in Calculated Metrics

Attribution models are also available in Calculated Metrics: 

![](../../assets/Calc_Metric_Settings.png) 

Once selected, you can choose from any available attribution model. It’s also possible to create Calculated Metrics from any combination of attribution models - for example, First Touch Orders minus Last Touch Orders would give you the difference between First Touch and Last Touch. 

Click [ here ](../../analysis_workspace_bucket/attribution.md#section_4B9E7F83AE0B451A992397E55C3F5871) to learn more about each attribution model and how they are calculated.
