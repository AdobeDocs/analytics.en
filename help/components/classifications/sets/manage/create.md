# Create a classification set

You can use the Classification set manager to create a classification set.

**[!UICONTROL Components]** > **[!UICONTROL Classification sets]** > **[!UICONTROL Sets]** > **[!UICONTROL Add]**

When creating a classification set, the following fields are available.

* **[!UICONTROL Name]**: A text field used to identify the classification set. This field cannot be edited upon creation, but can be renamed later.
* **[!UICONTROL Column Name]**: The name of the first classification dimension that you want to create. This field is the dimension name used in Analysis Workspace, and the column name when exporting classification data. You can add more column names after the classification set is created.
* **[!UICONTROL Type]**: Radio buttons that indicate the type of classification.
  * **[!UICONTROL Primary]**: Apply to dimensions collected in Analytics. They are a way to group (classify) granular dimension values into more meaningful levels of data. For example, you might want to group internal search keywords into internal search categories, to better understand themes in your search data.
  * **[!UICONTROL Lookup]**: Commonly referred to as child or subclassifications, a lookup table is a classification of a primary classification. It is metadata about a classification value, rather than the original dimension. For example, the Product variable might have a primary classification of 'Color code'. A lookup table of 'Color name' could then be attached to 'Color code' to further explain what each code means.
* **[!UICONTROL Subscriptions]** The report suites and dimensions that this classification set applies to. You can add multiple report suite and dimension combinations to a classification set.

If a classification set exists for a given report suite + variable, the classification is added to the schema instead. A given report suite + variable combination cannot belong to multiple classification sets.
