The following image and accompanying table explain the main elements in the Analysis Workspace user interface:

![Analysis Workspace window highlighting the various sections of the interface](assets/analysis-workspace-overview.png)

| Location | Name and function |
|:---------:|----------|
| A | Contains the name of the project, a menu structure to access functionality, a button ![Back button](/help/assets/icons/ChevronLeft.svg) to return back to your Project list, and a **[!UICONTROL Share]** button to [share your Workspace project](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/curate-share/share-projects.md). <br/>Select the name of your project (for example: New project) at any time to change the name. <br/>Select ![Unfavor](/help/assets/icons/StarOutline.svg) to mark your project as a favorite project ![Favor](/help/assets/icons/Star.svg). |
| B | **Button panel:** Contains buttons to access the key [features](#features) of Analysis Workspace:<ul><li>![WebPage](/help/assets/icons/WebPage.svg) [[!UICONTROL Panels]](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/c-panels/panels.md)</li><li>![GraphBarVertical](/help/assets/icons/GraphBarVertical.svg) [[!UICONTROL Visualizations]](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-analysis-visualizations.md)</li><li>![Curate](/help/assets/icons/Curate.svg) [[!UICONTROL Components]](/help/components/home.md)</li><li>![ViewList](/help/assets/icons/ViewList.svg) [[!UICONTROL Table of contents]](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/project-table-of-contents.md)</li><li>![Bookmark](/help/assets/icons/Bookmark.svg) [[!UICONTROL Data Dictionary]](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/data-dictionary/data-dictionary-overview.md)</li></ul> |
| C | **Left panel:** This area contains individual panels, visualizations, components, or lists. The content depends on the button selected in the button panel.  |
| D | **Canvas:** The main area where you drag content from the left panel to build your project. The project dynamically updates as you add panels, add visualizations to panels, and add components to visualizations. You can create multiple panels, and within each panel you can create multiple visualizations.<br/>Each panel is based on a selected report suite. The selected report suite determines available components like metrics and dimensions. See [Panels - Report suite](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/c-panels/panels.md#report-suite) for more information. |

## Use Analysis Workspace


To start using Analysis Workspace: 

1. Log in to [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://experience.adobe.com).
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Customer Journey Analytics]** from the app switcher ![App](/help/assets/icons/Apps.svg) at the top right of the interface.
1. The **[!UICONTROL Projects]** page of Analysis Workspace is shown by default. If a specific project has been selected for you or you have been working on recently, then that project is shown by default.

### Create a project

An analysis in Analysis Workspace is referred to as a [project](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md). 

You can create a project in Analysis Workspace as described in [Create projects](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/create-projects.md).

Projects can be organized into folders and subfolders, as described in [Folders in Analysis Workspace](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/workspace-folders/about-folders.md).

### Save and share a project

As you create an analysis in Analysis Workspace, your work is [automatically saved](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/save-projects.md). 

When you finish building out the project and it's gathering actionable insights, others might want to consume the project. You can share the project with users and groups in your organization, or even with people outside your organization. For information about sharing a project, see [Share projects](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/curate-share/share-projects.md).

The following image and accompanying table explain some of the main areas in Analysis Workspace:

![Analysis Workspace overview](assets/analysis-workspace-overvew.png)

| Location in image | Name and function |
|---------|----------|
| A | **Far left rail:** Contains tabs for adding panels, visualizations, and components to Analysis Workspace. Also contains the Data Dictionary icon that is used to open the Data Dictionary. |
| B | **Left rail:** Depending on which tab is selected in the far left rail, this area contains individual panels, visualizations, or components. |
| C | **Canvas:** This is the main area where you drag content from the left rails to build your project. The project dynamically updates as you add panels, visualizations, and components to the canvas. | 
| D | **Report suite drop-down menu:** For each panel in Analysis Workspace, the report suite drop-down menu allows you to choose the report suite that you want to use as your data source. | 

## Features in Analysis Workspace {#analysis}

Following are some of the key features available in Analysis Workspace: 

### Panels

**Panels** are used to organize your analysis within a project and can contain many tables & visualizations. Many of the panels provided in Analysis Workspace generate a full set of analyses based on a few user inputs. On the far left rail, select the top **[!UICONTROL Panels]** icon to see a full list of panels available.

To learn more about panels, see [Panels overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/panels/panels.html).

### Visualizations

**Visualizations**, such as a bar or line chart, can be used to visually bring data to life. On the far left rail, select the middle **[!UICONTROL Visualizations]** icon to see the full list of visualizations available. 

To learn more about visualizations, see [Visualizations overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-analysis-visualizations.html).

![](assets/build-visualizations.png)

### Components

Components in Analysis Workspace consist of the following:

* Dimensions

* Metrics

* Segments

* Date ranges

To learn more about each of these component types, see [Components overview](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/analysis-workspace-components.md). 

Each of these component types can be added to a visualization (such as a Freeform table) to start answering your business questions. 

After you understand component terminology, you can drag components into visualizations (including Freeform tables) to [build your analysis](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md).
