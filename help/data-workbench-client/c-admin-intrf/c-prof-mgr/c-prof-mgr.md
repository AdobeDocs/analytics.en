# Profile Manager

The Profile Manager is the main management tool in Data Workbench.

 It enables you to do the following:

* Edit configuration files (except for [!DNL report.cfg] files) and other types of files. 
* Publish local changes to a profile on the Insight Server. 
* Create new folders. 
* Edit your menu structure. See [Customizing Menus](../../../data-workbench-client/c-intf-anlys-ftrs/c-ctm-menus/c-ctm-menus.md#concept_93D4C09CB7F34CD293B7B64FBA1CF894). 
* Delete workspaces, templates, reports, and so on from Insight Server. 
* Manage metrics and dimensions.

For an overview of profiles, see [Working with Profiles](../../../data-workbench-client/c-get-started/c-work-prof.md#concept_57FF43DB95A34E83A39F819C7E6E42E1).
