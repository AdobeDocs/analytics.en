# Calculated metrics manager

The Calculated metrics page offers many ways of curating metrics, such as sharing, filtering, tagging, approving, copying, deleting, and marking as favorites.

The Calculated metrics page shows you all the segments you own and that have been shared with you. Admin-level users can see all custom metrics in the organization.
