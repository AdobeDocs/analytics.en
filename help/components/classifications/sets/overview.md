# Classification Sets Overview

Classification Sets provide a single interface to manage classifications and rules. This workflow combines the concept of creating classifications in Report Suite Settings with the concept of the Classification Importer to provide a more intuitive interface to create and manage classification data.

>[!NOTE]

>Classification sets will be available to all customers who have their report suites migrated to the new Classifications architecture. Please contact Adobe Customer Care or your Account Manager for more information.
