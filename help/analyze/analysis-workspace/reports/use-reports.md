# Use pre-built reports

Pre-built reports in Analysis Workspace provide quick insights into the most common reporting scenarios. Following are some examples of questions that you can answer with prebuilt reports:

* How many people visit your site 
* How many of those visitors are unique visitors (counted only once) 
* How they came to the site (such as whether they followed a link or came there directly) 
* What keywords visitors used to search site content 
* How long visitors stayed on a given page or on the entire site 
* What links visitors clicked, and when they left the site 
* Which marketing channels are most effective at generating revenue or conversion events 
* How much time they spent watching a video 
* Which browsers and devices they used to visit your site

The following information describes how to access and use pre-built reports from the [!UICONTROL Reports] tab in Analysis Workspace.

## Access and run a report

1. In Analysis Workspace, select the [!UICONTROL **Workspace**] tab.

1. Select [!UICONTROL **Reports**].

   ![Reports tab](assets/view-prebuilt-reports.png)

1. In the search field, begin typing the name of the report you want to find, then select it from the list of reports. You can also search the report list by prop, eVar, and event number. <!-- still true? -->

   Or

   Select the category of report that you want to view, then select the report from the list of reports.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >   To navigate the menu using the arrow keys, press the Forward Slash key (/), and then press the Down Arrow key. Press Enter to load the selected report.

For a list of reports that are available, see the [Available reports](#available-reports) section below.

## Save a report {#use-reports}

If you navigate away from a report after making changes, you are prompted to save or discard your changes. Saving changes to a report saves the report as a new project.

1. Go to the [!UICONTROL **Reports**] tab.
1. Select the report you want to view. For example, under [!UICONTROL **Most popular**], select the [!UICONTROL **Pages**] report.

   ![Pages report](assets/pages-report.png)

1. The Pages report, as displayed in Analysis Workspace, shows two [visualizations](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-analysis-visualizations.md) ([Bar chart](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/bar.md) and [Summary number](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/summary-number-change.md)) and a [Freeform table](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/freeform-table.md). The metric used is Occurrences.
1. Do any of the following:

   * View the report.
   * Drag one or more segments into the Segment drop zone at the top. For example, drag the segment [!UICONTROL **Mobile Customers**] and view the results. 
   * Change the date range by going to the calendar at the top-right.
   * Add dimension breakdowns, drag in other metrics, and generally customize the report to suit your needs.

1. (Optional) Save the report as a project by selecting [!UICONTROL **Project**] > [!UICONTROL **Save**].

   The report is saved as a new project; it does not modify the existing report. For more information about saving a report as a project, see [Save projects](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/save-projects.md).
