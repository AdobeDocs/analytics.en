1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Filter]**.

       After you save the filter, you can load it to use in other workspaces. See below how to load an existing filter or reference it by name in a [!UICONTROL Metric Editor]. See [Creating and Editing Derived Metrics](../../c-admin-intrf/c-prof-mgr/c-drvd-mtrcs.md#concept_E41723B342A849309874B26232224A40).

       >[!NOTE]
       >
       >If you would like all users of a profile to use the filters that you save, you must upload them to the appropriate profile using the [!UICONTROL Profile Manager]. See [Publishing Files to Your Working Profile](../../c-admin-intrf/c-prof-mgr/t-pub-files-wkg-prof.md#task_A0106E010C834D16BD60EEF4721B6AF9).
