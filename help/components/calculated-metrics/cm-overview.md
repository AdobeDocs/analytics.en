# Calculated metrics overview

Calculated are custom metrics that you can create from existing metrics.

Calculated metric are custom metrics that you can create from existing metrics. Calculated metrics offer a flexible way of to  build, manage, and curate custom metrics that enable you to analyze your data without having to change your implementation.

Calculated metrics are available in each [!DNL Analytics] package, however the Adobe Analytics Foundation Pack for Experience Cloud is limited to basic calculated metrics including [format types (decimal, time, percent, currency)](/help/components/calculated-metrics/workflow/c-build-metrics/cm-build-metrics.md), [allocation changes (default, linear, participation, etc.)](/help/components/calculated-metrics/workflow/c-build-metrics/m-metric-type-alloc.md), [metric types (standard, total)](/help/components/calculated-metrics/workflow/c-build-metrics/m-metric-type-alloc.md), and [basic operators](workflow/c-build-metrics/cm-build-metrics.md#operators) (add, subtract, multiply, and divide).


See the [Adobe Analytics Product Description](https://helpx.adobe.com/legal/product-descriptions/adobe-analytics.html) for more information.

## Capabilities {#section_A0A5C275B68A4D628950BBB0B1EE631F}

You can

* [Create metrics](/help/components/calculated-metrics/workflow/cm-workflow.md) across [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace], [!UICONTROL Report Builder], [!UICONTROL Anomaly Detection], and [!UICONTROL Contribution Analysis].
* [Create segmented metrics](/help/components/calculated-metrics/workflow/c-build-metrics/metrics-with-segments.md) that are derived at report run time, without having to change the implementation. For example, you can create a metric for *New visitors*, with a count of people for whom this is the first session.

* [Share metrics](/help/components/calculated-metrics/workflow/cm-sharing.md) across report suites. This means that all newly created metrics apply to all reports suites in the same login company.

* [Incorporate statistical functions](/help/components/calculated-metrics/cm-reference/cm-adv-functions.md) to help you better describe your data. For example, you can count the number of items in a report or add in the number of standard deviations for each item.

## Limitations

Some [!DNL Analytics] features do not allow the use of calculated metrics:

* [!UICONTROL Fallout] in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace] 
* [!UICONTROL Cohort Analysis] in Analysis Workspace 
* [!UICONTROL Data Warehouse] 
* [!UICONTROL Segments] 
* [!DNL Analytics] for [!DNL Target]

Here is a short overview of the [!UICONTROL Calculated metrics] tools: 

|Tool|Capabilities|
|--- |--- |
| [Calculated metric builder](workflow/c-build-metrics/cm-build-metrics.md)| The capabilities are: <ul><li>Create calculated and advanced calculated metrics using advancmd allocation models.</li><li>Add segments inline to metric formulas</li><li>Compare segments in the same report. For example, compare local visitors vs. international visitors.</li><li>Use statistical functions</li><li>Provide detailed metric descriptions (show what it does, where to use it, where NOT to use it)</li><li>Copy definitions into new metrics</li><li>Provide an inline metric preview</li><li>Set metric polarity, which indicates whether it's good or bad if a given custom event (metric) goes up</li><li>Tag metrics</li></ul>|
|Calculated Metric Manager|<ul><li>Share metrics with others</li<li>Approve and curate metrics</li><li>Organize (tag) your metrics so people can find them</li><li>Delete metrics</li><li>Rename metrics</li></ul>|
|Metric Selector rail|Lets you search for and add/apply metrics to the report. You can also change the  sort order (options are: alphabetical, recommended, frequently used, recently used.) In addition, you can filter on Report Suites to show only metrics created in a specific report suite.  To access this Metric Selector, click the Metrics icon  to the left of a report. |
|API for Calculated Metrics|Part of the Adobe Analytics 2.0 API set.|
