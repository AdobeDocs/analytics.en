# Report Builder reports

Manage license assigned to report builder users.

Every report builder license assigned to a user is automatically allocated ten scheduled tasks. This number of tasks can be adjusted and reallocated. Scheduled tasks cannot exceed the number of available tasks for each user. Any over-scheduled tasks do not run.

You can grant report builder access to any [!DNL Analytics] user by adding them to the report builder access group ( **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL User Management]** > **[!UICONTROL Groups]**).

The [!UICONTROL Scheduled Task Usage] information table displays all users with report builder access privileges.

See [Groups](../user-management2/c-user-groups/groups.md#concept_6C565553DCE3417C909234B2F044A02F).
