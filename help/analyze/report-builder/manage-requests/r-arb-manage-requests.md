Field descriptions for Manage Requests in Report Builder.

## Overview {#section_75C288C945FA4781A4EDF806711A5660}

The [!UICONTROL Request Manager] provides a detailed view of the status of all requests you have built for all sheets or just one sheet of the active workbook. You can also add, edit, refresh, and delete a request (functions typically associated with the [!UICONTROL Request Wizard] and [!UICONTROL Request Manager]) by right-clicking on an available cell in the Excel spreadsheet that contains previous requests.

The [!UICONTROL Request Manager] displays when you click **[!UICONTROL Manage]** ( ![](assets/edit_request.gif) in the Report Builder toolbar.

> [!NOTE] Adobe Report Builder enforces request dependencies only within the same worksheet, not across worksheets. Restricting to dependencies within a single worksheet ensures timeliness of execution.

   <td colname="col2"> <p>Refreshes all displayed requests. When you refresh all requests, the time to update the information from the server to your report is directly proportional to the complexity of the requests in the report. For very large reports, refreshing all requests may require several minutes. For this reason, you may wish to update the most urgent requests individually, and select <span class="wintitle"> Refresh All</span> at another, less time-crucial moment. </p> <p> <p>Note: It is recommended that you check results often in the <span class="wintitle"> Request Manager</span> if you refresh a worksheet containing multiple requests. If a request failure occurs, the error message in the diagnostic column helps you pinpoint the source of the error. While in most cases an error message is displayed when a request fails, note that occasionally no error message is generated. You may notice that a refresh does not update the data in a cell containing a reference, or that an update removes the data from the cell. </p> </p> </td>
