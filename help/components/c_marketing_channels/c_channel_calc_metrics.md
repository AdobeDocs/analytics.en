# Calculated metrics used Marketing Channel reports

Add calculated metrics to Marketing Channel reports in Analytics.

## Calculated metrics used Marketing Channel reports {#topic_4521D324A79E43EF99E69FCDE1E92F74}

Add calculated metrics to Marketing Channel reports in Analytics. 

Calculated metrics created in reports and analytics are available in the [!UICONTROL Marketing Channel] report, with first-touch and last-touch equivalents. For example, if you have created a calculated metric called Revenue per Order, that metric is available on the Marketing Channel report as *`First Touch Revenue per Order`* and *`Last Touch Revenue per Order`*.

You can create calculated metrics directly from the [!UICONTROL Marketing Channel Report]. Calculated metrics allow you to make useful comparisons between first-touch and last-touch channel metrics. For example, you can display the difference between first and last touch revenue.

If you are familiar with importing classifications, you can add numeric classifications and upload them via the Classifications Importer for use as cost and budget metrics.

See [Classifications](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/index.html?f=classifications) help.
