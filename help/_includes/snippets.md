## Reports & Analytics end-of-life announcement {#ra-eol}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Effective **January 17, 2024**, Adobe discontinued Reports & Analytics and its accompanying reports and features. At that time, Reports & Analytics and all of its reports and schedules stopped working. The reports, visualizations and underlying technology that power Reports & Analytics no longer meet Adobe's technology standards. Most Reports & Analytics features are available within Analysis Workspace. For information about using reports in Analysis Workspace, see [Use pre-built reports](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/reports/use-reports.md).
> 
>Since the release of Analysis Workspace in 2015, Reports & Analytics functionality and capabilities have been moved to Analysis Workspace and a threshold of workflow parity has been reached. This notice explains the end-of-life process.
