# Visitors

Shows the number of unique visitors to your site for a selected hour, day, week, month, quarter, or year. A unique visitor is counted only one time for the selected time frame. Visitors that return to your site are not counted as unique users again until the time frame has passed.

The total value displayed at the bottom of the table is the sum all of the visits for the specified time period and does not always reflect the number of unique visitors. For example, if you run a [!UICONTROL Daily Unique Visitors Report] with a time frame of several days, the total can include repeat visitors, because the same visitor might return on the next day and be counted again. However, if you run a [!UICONTROL Monthly Unique Visitors Report], the value in the Totals column accurately reflects how many unique visitors came during the month.

Marketing reports de-duplicate visitors based on the report title, independent of the calendar selection. For example, a visitor that visits four separate days in a reporting week is counted once in the Weekly Unique Visitor Report. In a Daily Unique Visitors Report spanning that week, the same visitor is counted four times. Therefore, the total value displayed at the bottom of the report table is the sum all of the visits for the specified time period and does not always reflect the number of unique visitors.
