# Schedule report requests

For example, you can schedule reports to be delivered immediately or on a recurring schedule, and specify the file format in [!DNL  Advanced Delivery Options]. The file size limit is 5 MB for a report upload. 

Additionally, after you create a report schedule in Report Builder, you can view and edit the schedule in ** [!UICONTROL  Analytics] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  Reports] **. (See [ Report Schedule and Distribution](http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/user/index.html#Report%20Schedule%20and%20Distribution) in Reports &amp; Analytics help.) 


>[!NOTE]
>
>You must have Excel 2007 or the compatibility pack installed in order to schedule a report.




>[!NOTE]
>
>You can have a maximum of 10 scheduled workbooks per Report Builder license. However, you can increase this number by subtracting from other licenses. To do so, go to ** [!UICONTROL  Admin] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  Company Settings] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  Report Builder Reports] **. 


>[!NOTE]
>
>A workbook that has been scheduled (or uploaded to the Workbook Library) and has not been touched (updated, replaced) in more than 28 months will be deleted.
