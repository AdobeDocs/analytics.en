# Zoom in or out in a visualization

You can zoom in or out on data in graphs, globes, process maps, and scatter plots.

## Zooming on objects in process maps and globes {#section_BE293F50337F49EE8F0F1EE3E613E4A1}

**To zoom in on an area**

* Point to the desired area, press and hold both mouse buttons, then move the mouse forward (away from you).

**To zoom out on an area**

* Point to the desired area, press and hold both mouse buttons, then move the mouse backward (toward you).

## Zooming on axes in graphs and scatter plots {#section_1438A5D637E84D68B69E269062DD3D7A}

Both graphs and scatter plots have axes that you can zoom in or out on separately (that is, you can zoom in on one axis, then zoom out on the other).

>[!NOTE]
>
>For the y-axis in a line graph and the x- or y-axis in a scatter plot, the zoom resets every time the underlying data changes. Because this happens quite often when working online, Adobe recommends that you work offline when you need to zoom these axes.
