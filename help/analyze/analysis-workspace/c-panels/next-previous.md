# Next or previous item panel

The [!UICONTROL Next or previous item] panel started out as a report in Reports & Analytics, under [!UICONTROL Reports] > [!UICONTROL Most popular] > [!UICONTROL Next page/Previous page]. It is now a Workspace panel as well. This panel contains a number of tables and visualizations to easily identify the next or previous dimension item for a specific dimension. For example, you might want to explore which pages customers went to most often after they visited the Home page.

## Access the panel

You can access the panel from within [!UICONTROL Reports] or within [!UICONTROL Workspace].

| Access point | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [!UICONTROL Reports] | <ul><li>The panel is already dropped into a project.</li><li>The left rail is collapsed.</li><li>If you selected [!UICONTROL Next page], default settings have already been applied, such as [!UICONTROL Page] for [!UICONTROL Dimension], and the top page as the [!UICONTROL Dimension Item], [!UICONTROL Next] for [!UICONTROL Direction] and [!UICONTROL Visit] for [!UICONTROL Container]. You can modify all these settings.</li></ul>![Next/Previous panel](assets/next-previous.png)|
| Workspace | Create a new project and select the Panel icon in the left rail. Then drag the [!UICONTROL Next or previous item] panel above the Freeform table. Notice that the [!UICONTROL Dimension] and [!UICONTROL Dimension Item] fields are left blank. Select a dimension from the drop-down list. [!UICONTROL Dimension items] are populated based on the [!UICONTROL dimension] you chose. The top dimension item gets added, but you can select a different item. The defaults are Next and Visitor. Again, you can modify these as well.<p>![Next/Previous panel](assets/next-previous2.png) |
