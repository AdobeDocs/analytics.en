## Go further with Customer Journey Analytics

Customer Journey Analytics is Adobe's next-generation Analytics solution that lets you use the power of Analysis Workspace with data from Adobe Experience Platform. It can break down, filter, query, and visualize years' worth of data, and is combined with Platform's ability to hold all kinds of data schemas and types. 

Following are some of the advantages of Customer Journey Analytics over Adobe Analytics:

* **Unlimited variables and events**: The concepts of eVars, props, and events no longer exist. Data is primarily focused on dimensions and metrics. Datasets can have an unlimited number of unique dimensions and metrics.

* **Unlimited unique values**: Adobe Experience Platform is not constrained to any unique limitations.

* **Alter historical data**: Using Adobe Experience Platform, data can be removed or corrected.

* **Cross-report-suite data**: Existing implementations from multiple datasets can be combined in Platform.
