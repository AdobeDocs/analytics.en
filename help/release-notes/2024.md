| ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ---- |
|**New documentation for upgrading from Adobe Analytics to Customer Journey Analytics** | For organizations upgrading from Adobe Analytics to Customer Journey Analytics, there are multiple upgrade options and many considerations to keep in mind based on an organization's current Adobe Analytics implementation and long-term goals. New documentation resources are now available to help you better understand:<ul><li>The various upgrade paths that exist</li><li>Which upgrade paths are available based on an organization's current Adobe Analytics implementation</li><li>The advantages and disadvantages of each upgrade path</li><li>Step-by-step guidance for each upgrade path</li><li>Considerations for handling historical data</li></ul>[Get started with the upgrade to Customer Journey Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/compare-aa-cja/upgrade-to-cja/cja-upgrade-getstarted)| | Available now |
| **Set `contextData` fields via XDM** | Customers sending data to Adobe Analytics via the Experience Edge Network can [set context data values](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/page-vars/contextdata) directly either in XDM or in the 'data' portions of the payload. |  | Available now |
| **Analytics Real-time Reporting 2.0 API** | The new Real-time Reporting API 2.0 in Adobe Analytics improves customer integration and provides rapid reporting results. These results can be used programmatically to work with basic, trended, and breakdown reports. [Learn more](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/2.0/guides/endpoints/reports/real-time/) | | May 30, 2024 | 
| **Streaming Media: Send web data to Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network with the Web SDK** | You can now use the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK to send Streaming Media web data to Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network. This enhancement allows you to build more personalized campaigns and provide more personalized content, resulting in more tracking data to report on.<p>This change provides a unified collection method for web implementations across all Platform solutions, such as Customer Journey Analytics, Adobe Real-time CDP, Adobe Journey Optimizer, and Event Forwarding. Previously, the only way to send Streaming Media web data to Edge Network was by using the Media Edge API. <p>[Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/edge-recommended/media-edge-sdk/edge-web-sdk)</p> | | May 29, 2024 |
| **Increase in default low-traffic thresholds**| In **mid April 2024**, Adobe will begin increasing the default report suite low-traffic thresholds as follows: ![low-traffic thresholds](assets/thresholds.png) This will impact only variables which are currently set below the new thresholds. These changes will be made incrementally, and we expect the work to be complete by the **end of May**. As these increases are rolled out, you may notice changes for high-cardinality variables:<ul><li>More dimension values may be available for reporting.</li><li>Segments and calculated metrics may include more data.</li><li>Virtual report suites based on segments may include more data.</li><li>Classification exports may include more data.</li></ul> | Mid April, 2024 | May 31, 2024  |
| **Administrator settings to control the accounts and locations that are used for export and import** | A new "Admin settings" tab in the Locations manager gives administrators control over whether users can create and edit accounts and locations. These settings apply when users configure cloud import and export accounts and configure cloud import and export locations. <p>Administrators can also limit the types of accounts (Google Cloud Platform, Azure RBAC, Amazon S3, and so forth) that users can create and use.</p><p>Previously, any user could create, edit, and use accounts and locations for any type of account.</p><p>(Updated documentation link to follow)</p> |  June 12, 2024 | June 30, 2024 |
| **Share accounts and locations that are used for export and import** | Users can now make the accounts and locations they create available to all users in their organization. Only account and location owners and system administrators can edit and delete accounts and locations.<p>Previously, accounts and locations could be used only by the user who created them.</p><p>These settings are available when users configure cloud import and export accounts and configure cloud import and export locations. </p> <p>(Updated documentation link to follow)</p> | June 12, 2024 | June 30, 2024 |
| **Activity Map to use fewer server calls for Web SDK** | Currently, Activity Map link events are counted as their own events and incur extra cost. This enhancement takes some link events and packages them into the next hit, similar to how events are handled by AppMeasurement. <p>(Updated documentation link to follow)</p> | Open Beta starts June 19, 2024 | TBD |

### Important notices for Adobe Analytics administrators

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **13-month expiration of saved `cust_visids`**  | May 22, 2024 | An upcoming release of the Analytics Hit processing engine, **targeted for July 2024**, will start enforcing a 13-month expiration of saved `cust_visids`. If the report suite has "Enable Visitor Stitching" enabled, this setting is used for finding the `cust_visid` for a `visid_high/visid_low value` with no `cust_visid` on the hit. Currently, there is no expiration of the mapping of a `cust_visid` for a `visid_high/visid_low`. With this release, if 13 months or more have passed since `visid_high/visid_low` has had a `cust_visid` on a hit, the mapping expires. | 
| **ISO region updates** | May 10, 2024 | Adobe will perform 2024 ISO region updates on June 7, 2024. Expect to see minor geo information (region) updates following this release. |

| **Migration to Adobe I/O OAuth Server-to-Server credentials** | May 11, 2023 |  Adobe Analytics API and Livestream customers using Adobe I/O JWT credentials must migrate to Adobe I/O OAuth Server-to-Server credentials by **January 1, 2025**. Adobe I/O will not allow new JWT credentials to be created beginning May 1, 2024. Customers using JWT must create a new OAuth Server-to-Server credential or migrate their existing JWT credential to an OAuth Server-to-Server credential. Customers must also update their client applications to use the new OAuth Server-to-Server credentials. <ul><li>[Migrating from Service Account (JWT) credentials](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/ServerToServerAuthentication/migration/)</li><li>[Implementation guide for new and old applications with OAuth](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/ServerToServerAuthentication/implementation/)<li>[Using the new OAuth Server-to-Server credentials](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/ServerToServerAuthentication/implementation/)</li><li>[FAQs](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/ServerToServerAuthentication/faqs/)</li></ul> |

## April 2024 {#apr24}

| Feature | Description | [Rollout starts](releases.md) | [General Availability](releases.md) |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| **Streaming Media: Send Roku data to Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network** | Now when [installing the Streaming Media Collection Add-on with Experience Platform Edge](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/edge-recommended/media-edge-sdk/implementation-edge), you can use the Adobe Experience Platform Roku SDK to send Streaming Media data to Adobe Experience Platform. |  | April 12, 2024 |
| **Improved workflow for Web SDK migration** | Datastreams now automatically map fields from the Web SDK data object straight to Adobe Analytics. [Data object mapping](/help/implement/aep-edge/data-var-mapping.md) is similar to [XDM object mapping](/help/implement/aep-edge/xdm-var-mapping.md), but does not require an XDM schema. This improved workflow provides the following benefits:<ul><li>It delays the requirement to use a schema until you are ready to send data to Adobe Experience Platform. If a schema was required at this stage of an implementation migration, you would be forced to use a schema based on Adobe Analytics fields. Adobe Experience Platform services, such as Customer Journey Analytics, don't have a concept of props or eVars. An Analytics-focused schema can introduce difficulties if your organization wants to use its own schema in the future.</li><li>After making implementation changes to the Web SDK, your organization is in a better position to migrate from Adobe Analytics to Customer Journey Analytics. If you send data to Adobe Analytics using the Web SDK, you do not need to make additional implementation changes to send data to Adobe Experience Platform. Instead, you can use data prep to map data object fields to your XDM schema.</li></ul>See [Migrate from the Adobe Analytics tag extension to the Web SDK tag extension](/help/implement/aep-edge/web-sdk/analytics-extension-to-web-sdk.md) and [Migrate from AppMeasurement to the Web SDK](../implement/aep-edge/web-sdk/appmeasurement-to-web-sdk.md) for more information. |  | April 2024 |
| **Permissions enhancement for project-only [!UICONTROL Workspace] components** | Previously, if a user (User A) shared a project with another user (User B), and gave User B edit access to the project, User B would be able to edit the project. However, User B would not be able to edit [!UICONTROL Quick Segments] embedded in the project. That limitation is now removed - User B can edit [!UICONTROL Quick Segments] and other project-only components that are embedded in the shared project. |  | April 17, 2024 |
| **Use the same cloud accounts for [!UICONTROL Data Feeds], [!UICONTROL Data Warehouse], and [!UICONTROL Classification sets]** | Cloud accounts and locations that you create can now be used for exporting data (with [!UICONTROL Data Feeds] and [!UICONTROL Data Warehouse]) and importing data (with [!UICONTROL Classification sets]).<p> **Changes when configuring accounts:** Users can [Configure cloud import and export accounts](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/components/locations/configure-import-accounts) and [Configure cloud import and export locations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/components/locations/configure-import-locations) that can be used for any of the following purposes:<ul><li>Importing data with [!UICONTROL Classification sets]</li><li>Exporting data with [!UICONTROL Data Feeds]</li><li>Exporting data with [!UICONTROL Data Warehouse].</li></ul><p>**Changes when managing accounts and locations from the [!UICONTROL Locations] page**: Users can use the [Locations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/components/locations/locations-manager) page (under [!UICONTROL Components] > Loc[!UICONTROL ]ations) to view and manage all the accounts and locations that they create, regardless of where they were created. <p>Previously, the [!UICONTROL Locations] page applied only to accounts that were created for importing data with [!UICONTROL Classification sets].</p>**Changes when managing locations from [!UICONTROL Data Warehouse] or [!UICONTROL Classification sets]**<p>When managing locations within a given application area ([!UICONTROL Data Warehouse] or [!UICONTROL Classification sets]), only the locations that were created in that specific application area are available. For example, when viewing the [!UICONTROL Data Warehouse] application area, only [!UICONTROL Data Warehouse] locations are available. All accounts are still available in each application area, regardless of the application area where they were created. Previously, all accounts and locations were available in each application area, regardless of the application area where they were created. This is still true when viewing the [!UICONTROL Data Feeds] application area. | | April 17, 2024 |
| **Administrators can manage all locations and accounts in their organization** | A new option on the Locations tab (on the Components > Locations page) allows Administrators to view and manage all locations in the organization.<p>A new option on the [Location](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/components/locations/locations-manager) accounts tab (on the Components > Locations page) allows Administrators to view and manage all accounts in the organization.</p> <p>Previously, administrators could view and manage only the locations and accounts that they created.</p> |  | April 17, 2024 |
| **Increase in default low-traffic thresholds**| In **mid April 2024**, Adobe will begin increasing the default report suite low-traffic thresholds as follows: ![low-traffic thresholds](assets/thresholds.png) This will impact only variables which are currently set below the new thresholds. These changes will be made incrementally, and we expect the work to be complete by the **end of May**. As these increases are rolled out, you may notice changes for high-cardinality variables:<ul><li>More dimension values may be available for reporting.</li><li>Segments and calculated metrics may include more data.</li><li>Virtual report suites based on segments may include more data.</li><li>Classification exports may include more data.</li></ul> | Mid April, 2024 | May 31, 2024  |
| **Activity Map uses fewer server calls for Web SDK** | Currently, Activity Map link events are counted as their own events and incur extra cost. <p>This enhancement takes some link events and packages them into the next hit, similar to how events are handled by AppMeasurement.</p> |  | May 31, 2024 |

| **Activity Map for Web SDK without extra cost** | Currently, Activity Map link events are counted as their own events and incur extra cost. This enhancement takes some link events and packages them into the next hit, similar to how events are handled by AppMeasurement. |  | March 6, 2024 |
| **Increase in default low-traffic thresholds**| In **mid April 2024**, Adobe will begin increasing the default report suite low-traffic thresholds as follows: ![low-traffic thresholds](assets/thresholds.png) This will impact only variables which are currently set below the new thresholds. These changes will be made incrementally, and we expect the work to be complete by the **end of May**. As these increases are rolled out, you may notice changes for high-cardinality variables:<ul><li>More dimension values may be available for reporting.</li><li>Segments and calculated metrics may include more data.</li><li>Virtual report suites based on segments may include more data.</li><li>Classification exports may include more data.</li></ul> | Mid April, 2024 | End of May, 2024 |
