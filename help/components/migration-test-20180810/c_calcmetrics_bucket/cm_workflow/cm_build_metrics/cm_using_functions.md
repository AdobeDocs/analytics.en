# Using Functions

For a list of all functions, refer to [ Basic Functions](cm_functions.md#concept_E3022D5EEEE145B69A23438BAF7016B2) and [ Advanced Functions](cm_adv_functions.md#concept_A5FB9127D70F4E1AA02D1ACBF4F54174). 

>[!NOTE]
>
>When including functions in a calculated metrics formula, always apply the function before dragging in metrics or segments.
