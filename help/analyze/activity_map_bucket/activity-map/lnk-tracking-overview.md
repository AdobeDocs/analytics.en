# Robust link tracking


* Includes the tracking of page regions to avoid cases of the same link being confused across different devices because the link shows up in different positions on the page;
* Ensures link uniqueness, meaning that distinct links cannot be mistaken for one because of issues with LinkID or across different browser makes.
