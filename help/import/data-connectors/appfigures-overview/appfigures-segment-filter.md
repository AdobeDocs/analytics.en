# Segmenting App Data{#segmenting-app-data}

An appFigures integration is often used to collect data for multiple applications across multiple app stores. You can create segments to isolate report data for a specific app or app store.

Segmentation guidelines for appFigures data:

* Must use page view containers only.
* Must use only [AppFigures dimensions](/help/import/data-connectors/appfigures-overview/appfigures-metrics.md) in filtering rules.
* Can use multiple segment rules as long as only [AppFigures dimensions](/help/import/data-connectors/appfigures-overview/appfigures-segment-filter.md) are referenced.
* Can use both the Include and Exclude canvas.
* Segments apply only to Adobe Analytics v15.
