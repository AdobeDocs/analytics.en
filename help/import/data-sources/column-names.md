# Data source column names

When uploading data source files, column headers are required. These column headers are case-sensitive, and apply to all report suites. Use the following table to make sure that each header in your data source file is set correctly. AppMeasurement variable name is also provided for reference.

> [!TIP] You can make a data sources file from scratch if you include the correct headers in your data source file.
