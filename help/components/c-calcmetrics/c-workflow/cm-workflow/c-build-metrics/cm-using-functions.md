# Use functions

Functions let you filter/sort your data and do statistical analysis.

For a list of all functions, refer to [Basic Functions](../../../../../components/c-calcmetrics/cm-reference/cm-functions.md#concept_E3022D5EEEE145B69A23438BAF7016B2) and [Advanced Functions](../../../../../components/c-calcmetrics/cm-reference/cm-adv-functions.md#concept_A5FB9127D70F4E1AA02D1ACBF4F54174).

>[!NOTE]
>
>When including functions in a calculated metrics formula, always apply the function before dragging in metrics or segments.
