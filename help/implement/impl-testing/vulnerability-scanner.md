# Vulnerability scanner

Whenever users are allowed to input values that are stored in Analytics or any other JavaScript variables, values should be properly escaped or URIEncoded.

We highly recommend using a vulnerability scanning service to avoid injection attacks and other potential exploits that might be present in your code.
