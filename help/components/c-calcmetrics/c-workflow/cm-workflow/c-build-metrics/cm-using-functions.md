# Use functions

Functions let you filter/sort your data and do statistical analysis.

For a list of all functions, refer to [Basic functions](/help/components/c-calcmetrics/cm-reference/cm-functions.md) and [Advanced functions](/help/components/c-calcmetrics/cm-reference/cm-adv-functions.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>When including functions in a calculated metrics formula, always apply the function before you drag in metrics or segments.
