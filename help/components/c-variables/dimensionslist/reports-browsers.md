The Browsers report might contain a browser with an unknown version.

Adobe Analytics uses a lookup table to populate the browsers report. These lookup table entries are version-specific. Therefore, when an organization (such as Mozilla) updates their browser, Analytics doesn't recognize the exact version used. When this event occurs, it specifies the general browser followed with an unknown version. For more information, see [this Knowledge Base article](https://helpx.adobe.com/analytics/kb/browser-unknown-version.html).
