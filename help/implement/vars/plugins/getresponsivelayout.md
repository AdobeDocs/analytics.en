# Adobe plug-in: getResponsiveLayout

> [!IMPORTANT] This plug-in is provided by Adobe Consulting as a courtesy to help you get more value out of Adobe Analytics. Adobe Customer Care does not provide support with this plug-in, including installation or troubleshooting. If you require help with this plug-in, contact your organization's Account Manager. They can arrange a meeting with a consultant for assistance.

The `getResponsiveLayout` plug-in lets you track which version of your responsive design-based website a visitor is currently looking at. Adobe recommends using this plug-in if your site uses responsive design and you want to track the version of the site viewed by a visitor. This plug-in is unnecessary if your site does not use responsive design.

## Install the plug-in using the Adobe Experience Platform Launch extension

Adobe offers an extension that allows you to use most commonly-used plug-ins.

1. Log in to [launch.adobe.com](https://launch.adobe.com) using your AdobeID credentials.
1. Click the desired property.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click on the [!UICONTROL Catalog] button
1. Install and publish the [!UICONTROL Common Analytics Plugins] extension
1. If you haven't already, create a rule labeled "Initialize Plug-ins" with the following configuration:
    * Condition: None
    * Event: Core â€“ Library Loaded (Page Top)
1. Add an action to the above rule with the following configuration:
    * Extension: Common Analytics Plugins
    * Action Type: Initialize getResponsiveLayout
1. Save and publish the changes to the rule.

## Install the plug-in using Launch custom code editor

If you do not want to use the plug-in extension, you can use the custom code editor.

1. Log in to [launch.adobe.com](https://launch.adobe.com) using your AdobeID credentials.
1. Click on the desired property.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click the [!UICONTROL Configure] button under the Adobe Analytics extension.
1. Expand the [!UICONTROL Configure tracking using custom code] accordion, which reveals the [!UICONTROL Open Editor] button.
1. Open the custom code editor and paste the plug-in code provided below into the edit window.
1. Save and publish the changes to the Analytics extension.

## Install the plug-in using AppMeasurement

Copy and paste the following code anywhere in the AppMeasurement file after the Analytics tracking object is instantiated (using `s_gi`). Preserving comments and version numbers of the code in your implementation helps Adobe with troubleshooting any potential issues.

```js
/******************************************* BEGIN CODE TO DEPLOY *******************************************/
/* Adobe Consulting Plugin: getResponsiveLayout v1.0 */
var getResponsiveLayout=function(ppw,plw,tw){if(!(isNaN(ppw)||isNaN(plw)||isNaN(tw)||plw<ppw||tw<plw)){var b=window.innerWidth|| document.documentElement.clientWidth||document.body.clientWidth;return(ppw<plw&&b<=plw?b<=ppw?"phone portrait layout":"phone landscape layout":b<=plw?"phone layout":b<=tw?"tablet layout":"desktop layout")+":"+b+"x"+(window.innerHeight|| document.documentElement.clientHeight||document.body.clientHeight)}};
/******************************************** END CODE TO DEPLOY ********************************************/
```

## Use the plug-in

The `getResponsiveLayout` method uses the following arguments:

* **`ppw`** (required, integer): The maximum width of pixels a browser window can have before the page switches from a phone portrait layout to a phone landscape-based layout
* **`plw`** (required, integer): The maximum width of pixels a browser window can have before the page switches from a phone landscape layout to a tablet-based layout
* **`tw`** (required, boolean): The maximum width of pixels a browser window can have before the page switches from a tablet layout to a desktop-based layout

Calling this method returns a string containing two parts. The first part uses of of the following values, depending on the browser's width and the above arguments:

* `"phone portrait layout"`
* `"phone landscape layout"`
* `"phone layout"` (for sites that don't have both portrait and landscape layouts)
* `"tablet layout"`
* `"desktop layout"`

The second part of the returned string is the browser's width and height dimensions. For example, `"desktop layout:1243x700"`.

## Example Calls

### Example #1

If...

* Your site switches from phone portrait mode to phone landscape mode when the browser width is greater than 500 pixels
* Your site switches from phone landscape mode to tablet mode when the browser width is greater than 700 pixels
* Your site switches from tablet mode to desktop mode when the browser width is greater than 1000 pixels

...the following code will set eVar10 equal to the current responsive design layout as experience by the visitor as well as the browser's width and dimensions

```js
s.eVar10 = getResponsiveLayout(500, 700, 1000);
```

### Example #2

If...

* Your site has only a phone mode, a tablet mode, and a desktop mode
* Your site switches from phone mode to tablet mode when the browser width is greater than 500 pixels
* Your site switches from tablet mode to desktop mode when the browser width is greater than 1,100 pixels

...the following code will set eVar10 equal to the current responsive design layout as experience by the visitor as well as the browser's width and dimensions

```js
s.eVar10 = getResponsiveLayout(500, 500, 1100);
```
