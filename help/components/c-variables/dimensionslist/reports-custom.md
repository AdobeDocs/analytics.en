Administrators can configure a report with specific metrics and a specific date range, and then save it to the report menus for everyone to use.

Custom reports can bring increased value to you as an analyst. If you see reports in your SiteCatalyst interface that don't match someone else's (such as in Training), your administrator may have set up some of these custom reports.

Additionally, you can save reports that are important to you. These reports are called bookmarks. You can also put several reports onto one canvas to get a quick look at your most important reports. These are called dashboards and are also user-specific. The interface displays a bar above the graph listing your bookmarks and dashboards.

See [Bookmarks](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/user/c_bookmarks.html) and [Dashboards and Reportlets](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/admin/server-call-usage/server-call-usage-dashboard.html) for more information.
