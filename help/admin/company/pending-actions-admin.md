# Pending actions

The Manage Pending Actions page lets you view a list of pending actions in your Analytics environment. A pending action is any system change that requires approval from Adobe before implementation.

Pending Actions displays requests that are not immediately applied to your report suites. These requests typically require additional action from Adobe. For example, a request for a 20-item correlation or a large increase in traffic might require additional hardware. Assigning these requests a status of pending lets Adobe prepare for the requested change to prevent disruption to your data collection process.
