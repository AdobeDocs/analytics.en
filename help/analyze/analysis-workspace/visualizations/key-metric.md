# Key metric summary

The Key Metric Summary visualization lets you see how important metrics are trending and compares metric performance across two timeframes. It provides the insight of multiple visualizations combined into one visualization:

* Line visualizations for two timeframes

* Summary percent change between the two timeframes

* Current total value (summary number) for the metric

## Use cases

This visualization addresses multiple common use cases:

* An analyst trying to understand how different sales look this month compared to the same timeframe last year. 

* A marketer exploring how lead generation for a specific lead type has changed from this month to last month.

* An executive trying to understand how new bookings changed from this quarter to last quarter.

## Configure the key metric summary

1. Drag the **[!UICONTROL Key metric summary]** visualization from the **[!UICONTROL Visualizations]** menu in the left rail into a [!UICONTROL Freeform] table.
