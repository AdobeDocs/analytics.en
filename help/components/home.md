Analytics components help you fine tune and empower your analysis of data. Components include:

* **Segmentation:** Focus on a subset of your data.
* **Calculated metrics:** Use simple formulas to combine metrics, or advanced functions for statistical analysis.
* **Virtual report suites:** Create a virtual silo of data based on a report suite. Allows the ability to cleanse or segment data for a better user experience. Some features can only be used in virtual report suites.
* **Alerts:** Receive notifications any time data goes above or below a threshold.
* **Classifications:** Reorganize and group dimensions to obtain additional insight.
* **Variables:** A reference guide to all dimensions and metrics available in reporting.
* **Real-time reporting:** Get reports and trends the minute they are available.
* **Marketing channels:** Understand how visitors arrive to your site and determine which channels are most successful.
