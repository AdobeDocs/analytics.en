   <td colname="col2"> <p>By default, the Audience Analytics integration for AAM sends all segments that a visitor qualifies for, on a per-hit basis, to Analytics. If a visitor belongs to more than 150 AAM segments on a single hit, the <b>150 most recently qualified segments</b> are sent to Analytics, while the remaining list is truncated. </p> <p>An additional flag is sent to Analytics signifying that the segment list was truncated, and displays as "Audience limit reached" in the Audience Name dimension and "-1" in the Audience ID dimension. </p> <p>While it is unlikely that a visitor qualifies for more than 150 segments on a particular hit, it may happen a small percentage of the time. If you experience "Audience limit reached" in your reporting, you have two options: </p>

     <li id="li_12F498981EA949B5BCBD40ECC954C339"><b>Option 1</b>: Continue to let the integration work in its out-of-the-box state, sending the 150 most recently qualified segments for a particular visitor. </li> 
     <li id="li_CA4D5747AA4A4452929097807B604959"><b>Option 2</b>: In AAM, choose the 150 segments that matter most to your business for the integration. AAM then checks visitors against only those 150 segments. The disadvantage of this approach is that you only receive those 150 segments across all visitors. On the other hand, the Option 1 approach can deliver unlimited segments due to the per-hit nature of the integration. </li>

   <td colname="col1"> <p><b>Q: Will additional server calls be billed to Analytics for this integration?</b> </p> </td>
