# Curate projects

Curation lets you limit the components (dimensions, metrics, segments, date ranges) before sharing a project. When a recipient opens the project, they see a limited set of components that you have curated for them. Curation is an optional but recommended step before sharing a project. 

>[!NOTE]
> Product profiles are the primary mechanism governing which components a user can see. They are managed through the Adobe Experience Cloud Admin Console. Curation is a secondary filter.

## Apply project curation

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Share]** > **[!UICONTROL Curate Project Data]**. 
   The components that are used in the project are automatically added. 
   If a project has multiple report suites, you see a curate drop target for each report suite in the project. 
1. (Optional) To add more components, drag components you want to share from the left panel to the **[!UICONTROL Curate components]** drop zone for the data view. 
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Done]**.

When a recipient opens a curated project, they only see the curated set of components you have defined:


## Remove project curation

To remove project curation and restore the full set of components in the left rail:

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Share]** > **[!UICONTROL Curate Project Data]**. 
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Remove Curation]**. 
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Done]**.

## Virtual report suite curation

To apply curation at a report-suite level, so that it applies to many projects at once, you can [curate components in a Virtual Report suite](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/components/virtual-report-suites/vrs-components). 

>[!NOTE]
>
> Virtual report suite curation is always applied before project curation. Even if your curated project includes certain components, they are filtered out if the curated Virtual report suite does not include these components.

## Component curation options

In a curated project or virtual report suite, the recipient is presented with the option to **[!UICONTROL Show All]** components in the left rail. [!UICONTROL Show All] reveals different sets of components, depending on:

* The user's permission level (admin or non-admin)
* Project role (owner/editor or not)
* Type of curation applied (Virtual report suiteS or project)
* Components owned by or shared to the user. Owned/shared components include segments, calculated metrics, and date ranges. They do not include implemented components, such as eVars, props, and custom events. 

Note: Non-admin view roles do not have access to the left rail in a project, so they have been omitted from the table below.

|Curation Type|Admins|Non-Admin project owner or edit role|Non-Admin duplicate role|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Curated Virtual report suite**|All non-curated Virtual report suite components|Non-curated Virtual report suite components that this role owns or that have been shared with them|Non-curated Virtual report suite components that this role owns or that have been shared with them|
|**Curated Project**|All non-curated project components|All non-curated project components|Non-curated project components that this role owns or that have been shared with them|
|**Curated Project in a Curated Virtual report suite**| All non-curated components, shown under **[!UICONTROL Non-Curated Project Components]** and **[!UICONTROL Non-Curated Virtual report suite components]**| All non-curated project components AND non-curated Virtual report suite components that this role owns or that have been shared with them|Non-curated Virtual report suite and project components that this role owns or that have been shared with them|
