# Entries

Entries represents the number of times a given value is captured as the first value in a visit. Entries can occur only once per visit. However, it is not necessarily the first hit if the variable is not defined.

Entry pages have a visit breakdown scope, meaning they persist across all hits for a visit. See [Breakdown and segmentation containers](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/user/c_Breakdown_and_segmentation_containers.html) for more information.
