# About changing the event type

Describes the consequences of changing an event type after data has been collected.

## Version 15 Report Suites with Historical Version 14 Data {#section_81A7EFE7E1C34368801F1BDEE1607444}

In version 15, you can change an event from counter, numeric, or currency to another type without losing access to previously captured data. However, if you change an event type, any historical version 14 data that was captured as the previous type is hidden until the type is changed back.

For these report suites, do not change an event type unless you understand that you will lose access to historical version 14 data for that event. The historical version 14 event data is displayed only when the current event type matches the captured event type.

## Version 15 Report Suites {#section_D91718867C6540F3BCE65E46AA0D41DA}

In version 15, you can change an event from counter, numeric, or currency to another type without losing access to previously captured data.
