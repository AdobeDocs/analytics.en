# Alerts manager

You can manage existing alerts in the Alerts manager. You can perform various management tasks on alerts, such as tagging, renaming, deleting, and more.

The Alerts manager is structured very much like the [Segment Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-manage.html) and the [Calculated Metric Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/calculated-metrics/calcmetric-workflow/cm-manager.html).

1. Select the alert type that corresponds to the alert that you want to create:

   * [!UICONTROL **Analytics data alert**]: An alert to notify you when abnormal events occur in your data. 

     If you select this option, continue with [Create alerts](/help/components/c-alerts/alert-builder.md) for more details about creating alerts.

   * [!UICONTROL **Server call usage alert**]: An alert to notify you of the risk or occurrence of an overage in your server call consumption and commitment data. 

     If you select this option, continue with [Server call usage alerts](/help/admin/admin/c-server-call-usage/scu-alerts.md).

     >[!NOTE]
