### Add descriptions to components in Analysis Workspace {#add-descriptions}

The Data Dictionary in Analysis Workspace helps both users and administrators keep track of and better understand the components in their Analytics environment. 

Part of this is the ability for Analytics administrators to add descriptions for components directly within Analysis Workspace. 

For more information about the Data Dictionary, see [Data Dictionary overview](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/data-dictionary/data-dictionary-overview.md).

To add descriptions for components using the Data Dictionary:

1. Go to the Analysis Workspace project that contains the component for which you want to add a description.

1. Select the Data Dictionary icon on the left side of Analysis Workspace.

   The Data Dictionary window displays.
