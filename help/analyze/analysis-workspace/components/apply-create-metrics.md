# Metrics

There are two ways to use metrics in Analysis Workspace.

You can either drag a standard metric, calculated metric, or calculated metric template from the [!UICONTROL Components] menu to the table:

>While this is seemingly simple, the use of metrics is rather powerful. You can add metrics to a report by dragging the appropriate metric to the metrics section of a table. You can also break down dimensions by metrics, giving you fine-grained control over the table view. Furthermore, you can insert a metric as a dimension and a dimension as a metric to create an overtime report. Play around with the various components and see what you can do. The possibilities are endless.

Or you can click **[!UICONTROL Components]** > **[!UICONTROL New Metric]**. This will take you to the [Calculated Metric Builder](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/calcmetrics/), where you can build custom metrics from existing metrics.

To make it easier to quickly create calculated metrics, **[!UICONTROL Create metric from selection]** has been added to the column right-click menu in Freeform Tables. This option displays when one or more header column cells are selected.
