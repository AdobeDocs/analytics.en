# Getting started with Reports and Analytics

Before using Reports and Analytics, understand these basic login and setup tasks, and how to access account information.

## Getting started with Reports and Analytics {#concept_8C531D94965743BFBED7A87FE5473FF0}

Before using Reports and Analytics, understand these basic login and setup tasks, and how to access account information. 

Reporting provides insights into your traditional web-based channels as well as evolving channels like mobile, video, and social networking. Some examples of marketing reports include:

* How many people visit your site 
* How many of those visitors are unique visitors (counted only once) 
* How they came to the site (such as whether they followed a link or came there directly) 
* What keywords visitors used to search site content 
* How long visitors stayed on a given page or on the entire site 
* What links visitors clicked, and when they left the site 
* Which marketing channels are most effective at generating revenue or conversion events 
* How much time they spent watching a video 
* Which browsers and devices they used to visit your site

## Browser and system requirements {#concept_7E987A1E578940B1859D89CA14FAFF34}

      >In January 2016, Adobe ended support for Internet Explorer 9 and 10.
