# Customize metric permissions

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>User and product management is moving to the [Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-console.html). Adobe will notify you when it is your time to migrate users. After all customers have migrated, help content for **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL All admin]** > **[!UICONTROL User management]** will be retired.

Enable permissions for traffic metrics, conversion metrics, custom events, solution events, and content aware.

 **[!UICONTROL User Management]** > **[!UICONTROL Groups]** > **[!UICONTROL Report Access]** > **[!UICONTROL Metrics]** > **[!UICONTROL Customize]**

The settings on the Customize Metrics page apply to the report suites selected on the [!UICONTROL Define User Groups] page.

## Solution Events

In addition to [Custom Events](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/page-vars/events/event-serialization.html), this category includes Analytics solution events, including Experience Manager (AEM), Advertising Cloud (AMO), Mobile, Video, and Social.). Every custom group with any metrics will have all Analytics solution events added as new metrics.

You can set permissions to Custom Events and Analytics solution events (AEM, AMO, Mobile, Video, and Social).

Every custom group with any metrics will have all Analytics Solution events added as new metrics.

See [Metrics overview](/help/components/metrics/overview.md) for information about metrics used in Analytics.

## Content Aware

Content Aware includes variables that let you manage the permissions on metrics related to Experience Cloud solution integrations. You can manage permissions on [!DNL Social], [!DNL Mobile], or any other data that was inserted through a [!DNL Experience Cloud] integration. These will be enabled by default.
