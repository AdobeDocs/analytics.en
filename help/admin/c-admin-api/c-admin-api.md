# Adobe Analytics APIs

The following Adobe Analytics APIs are available on the Adobe Developer site: 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If you are creating a new integration, Adobe strongly recommends using the 2.0 APIs. 


* [**Adobe Analytics 2.0 APIs**](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/2.0/): The Adobe Analytics 2.0 APIs allow you to directly call Adobe's servers to perform almost any action that you can perform in the user interface. 

* [**Adobe Anaytics 1.4 APIs**](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/1.4/): The Adobe Analytics 1.4 APIs are the predecessor to the Analytics 2.0 APIs. They allow for the creation of data rich user interfaces that you can use to manipulate and integrate data.
