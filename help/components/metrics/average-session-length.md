# Average session length (mobile)

The 'Average session length (mobile)' metric shows the average amount of time a given dimension value is present per dimension value. It is similar to the [Average time on site](average-time-on-site.md) metric, except this metric uses mobile SDK specific components as part of its calculation.

## How this metric is calculated

This metric is calculated using the [mobile metrics](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/mobile-services/using/get-started-ug/mobile-metrics/metrics-reference.html) `'Total session length' / ('Launches' - 'First launches'`.
