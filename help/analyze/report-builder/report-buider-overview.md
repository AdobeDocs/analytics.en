# About the new Adobe Report Builder

The new Javascript Report Builder Add-in that was initially available only in Customer Journey Analytics is now also being introduced in Adobe Analytics. This new version has several advantages:

- Support for Analytics 2.0 API
- Support for Excel on Mac, Microsoft Windows, and web browsers
- Removal of support for legacy technologies that the Legacy Adobe Report Builder was built on.

Report Builder allows you to easily create, edit, and refresh custom reports using Adobe Analytics data. With Report Builder's simple and flexible drag-and-drop UI, you can create complex data queries and custom reports from Adobe Analytics data, all within Excel.

With Report Builder, you can:

- Reference existing worksheet cells to get the perfect row order, date range, or filter
- Create custom dates using calendar, cell references, or date math
- Design your tables and visualizations with familiar Excel formatting tools

Report Builder is available for Excel on the following platforms:

- macOS
- Microsoft Windows
- Web browsers

## Common use cases

- **Data Extraction**: Adobe Report Builder allows you to extract data from Adobe Analytics into Excel. You can create custom reports and queries to retrieve specific data points that are relevant to your analysis. 

- **Custom Reporting**: You can design and format custom reports in Excel to suit your specific reporting needs. This is especially useful for tailoring reports to different stakeholders. 

- **Ad-Hoc Analysis**: Users can quickly generate ad-hoc reports to answer specific questions or explore data trends without having to go through a lengthy report creation process. 

- **Dashboarding**: Data extracted from CJA can be used to create Excel-based dashboards and visualizations for a high-level overview of key performance indicators (KPIs). 

- **Sharing Insights**: You can share Excel reports and insights with team members or stakeholders who might not have direct access to CJA.
