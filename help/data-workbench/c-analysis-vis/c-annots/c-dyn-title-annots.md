# Dynamic title annotations

Using Report, you can generate reports dynamically for the dimension elements that you specify in a lookup file or for a particular number of the dimension elements, such as for the users with the 10 highest order counts.

Using a dynamic title annotation, you can display a title in a dynamic report that identifies either the dimension element name currently being processed by [!DNL Report] or the dimension element name that you have selected to view. Dynamic title annotations enable you to identify which elementâ€™s data you are viewing on the report without altering any of the other visualizations or accidentally sorting a selection by a particular element.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This functionality is available only when you have licensed [!DNL Report]. For more information about [!DNL Report], see the * [!DNL Data Workbench] Report Guide*.

For more information about dynamically generating reports, see the *Insight Report Guide*.

**To set up a dynamic title annotation**

* Right-click within the dynamic title annotation and click **[!UICONTROL Change Dimension]** > *< **[!UICONTROL dimension name]**>*.
