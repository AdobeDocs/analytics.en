# Next Section Flow

Next Section Flow is similar to the Next Page Flow. It displays data for Site Sections (groups of related web pages). If a page is contained in more than one site section, it displays data for all site sections.

 For example, an online retailer might have site sections for its products and site sections for product brands. In this case, a product web page can fall under multiple sight sections. Though a product page has only been viewed once, Next Section Flow shows a page view for each sight section associated with the page.
