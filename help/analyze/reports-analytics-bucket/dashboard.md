# Dashboards and reportlets

A dashboard is a collection of thumbnail reports called reportlets. A dashboard is most useful when it contains related reportlets that give you complete overviews of certain aspects of your site, such as finding methods, visitor profiles, and so on.

## Dashboards and reportlets {#concept_8CD3ACA2830A4994A68A31D8773B57E0}

A dashboard is a collection of thumbnail reports called *`reportlets`*. A dashboard is most useful when it contains related reportlets that give you complete overviews of certain aspects of your site, such as finding methods, visitor profiles, and so on. 

You can add most marketing reports to a dashboard, including graphically intense reports like the [!UICONTROL Fallout Report], [!UICONTROL Conversion Funnel Report], and the [!UICONTROL Pathfinder Report].

You can also set a dashboard as your landing page, share dashboards with other users, and schedule them for delivery. If you do not set a dashboard (or a bookmark) as a landing page, the [!UICONTROL My Recommended Reports] dashboard displays. **[!UICONTROL My Recommended Reports]** shows the **[!UICONTROL Key Metrics]** report plus your five most frequently viewed reports. It is dynamic and based on the actual reports that you view the most.

Be aware that some frequently viewed reports cannot be dashboarded and will not show up. These include:

* Anomaly Detection reports 
* Contribution Analysis reports 
* Fallout reports 
* Pathfinder reports 
* Real-time reports 
* Other dashboards

>[!NOTE]
>
>The **[!UICONTROL Site Overview]**dashboard is no longer listed in Reports & Analytics. However, there are still a couple of circumstances where you will see some or all of its reportlets. >
>* If you have, say, only three frequently viewed reports, Reports & Analytics will take two reports from the Site Overview dashboard to complete the **[!UICONTROL My Recommended Reports]** dashboard. 
>* Brand new report suites will also initially still feature the Site Overview reportlets, until they gets replaced by your frequently viewed reports. Even so, the dashboard will now be called **[!UICONTROL My Recommended Reports]**. 
>

In addition to the dashboards you create, the following prepackaged dashboards are included for each user:

Use the [!UICONTROL Dashboard Manager] to edit and manage dashboards, and enable them for DirectAccess.

## Create a dashboard {#task_54EFBED59BDC4418A919E6EF84AB9CFF}

Steps that describe how to create a dashboard.

<!-- 

t_dashboard_add.xml

 -->

Before adding a report (as a reportlet) to a dashboard, define the dashboard's layout. 

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Components]** > **[!UICONTROL Manage Dashboards]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Dashboard]**.
1. Type a name for the dashboard.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL 3 x 2]** or **[!UICONTROL 2 x 2]** to specify how many reportlets you want on the dashboard page.
1. Configure the dashboard page layout:

    * **[!UICONTROL Add Page]**: Adds a blank page to the dashboard, on which you can drag content to create reportlets. 
    * **[!UICONTROL Paper]**: Lets you specify a paper size, such as landscape, portrait, and A4. 
    * **[!UICONTROL Find Content]**: Lets you search for content in the [!UICONTROL Add Content] and [!UICONTROL Dashboard Contents] menus.

1. Add available content to the dashboard by dragging items to the reportlet canvas.

   See [Creating a Reportlet](../../analyze/reports-analytics-bucket/dashboard.md#task_EC3AFBBAA51C45CEBAF632F841C305B3) and [Editing Dashboard Settings](../../analyze/reports-analytics-bucket/dashboard.md#task_90D7FAC1CC3E4DB786B4C87CC33B5459).
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save.]**

   Saving a dashboard makes it available in the **[!UICONTROL Dashboard]** menu. The new dashboard is also available in the [!UICONTROL Dashboard Manager] ( **[!UICONTROL Favorites]** > **[!UICONTROL Dashboards]** > **[!UICONTROL Manager]**), where you can edit, organize, share, schedule, archive dashboards, and more. (See [Managing Dashboards](../../analyze/reports-analytics-bucket/dashboard-manage.md#concept_E1301CF138EB477794B00F693B4FCA0F).)

1. (Optional) To set the dashboard as your landing page, click **[!UICONTROL More Options]** > **[!UICONTROL Set as Landing Page]**.

## Create a reportlet {#task_EC3AFBBAA51C45CEBAF632F841C305B3}

Steps that describe how to create a reportlet. Once you create a reportlet, it is available to display in a dashboard.

<!-- 

t_dashboard_add_report.xml

 -->

1. Run a report.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Dashboard.]**
1. On the [!UICONTROL Add Reportlet] page, name the report, then select a dashboard from **[!UICONTROL Place in Dashboard]**.
1. (Optional) Configure the date range.

    * **[!UICONTROL Rolling]**: Changes the date as time passes, according to the time span (daily, monthly, and so on). For example, if today is January 17, you might set the dates for January 15 - 16. Then if you select **[!UICONTROL Rolling]**, on January 27 the reportlet displays data for January 25 - 26. 
    * **[!UICONTROL Fixed]**: Prevents the date from moving forward as time passes.

1. (Optional) Override the publishing distribution list.

   **[!UICONTROL Publishing List Override]**: If you enable this option, the report suite referenced in this reportlet is always used when distributed to a publishing list. If you disable this option, the report suite identified in the publishing list replaces the report suite in this reportlet. 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create New]**.

   The reportlet is added to the **[!UICONTROL Dashboard Contents]** menu in the dashboard editor. 

## Add content to a dashboard {#task_90D7FAC1CC3E4DB786B4C87CC33B5459}

Steps that describe how to add content from other dashboards and shared dashboards. You can also add content from custom and external sources, such as text and images.

<!-- 

t_dashboard_content.xml

 -->

1. Open a dashboard, then click **[!UICONTROL Layout]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Content]**, then drag items to the dashboard.

       The [!UICONTROL Add Content] menu displays reportlet content from other dashboards, legacy dashboards, and shared dashboards.

## Edit dashboard and reportlet data {#task_B460CCD70D9F40FCAC6BBC1C044CC460}

You can change data settings at the dashboard or reportlet level. For example, you can change the report suite, locking the report suite, changing dates, applying segments, and so on. You can also personalize a dashboard by inserting your company's confidentiality statement, and include HTML, XML, Web API, and CSV data in customized reportlets.

## Co-brand a dashboard {#task_603BDE7700B945699AF5514C2DEB81F7}

Steps that describe how to upload an image to display in a dashboard.

<!-- 

t_dashboard_branding.xml

 -->

1. **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Company Settings]**.
1. On the [!UICONTROL Company Settings] page, click **[!UICONTROL Co-Brand the Adobe Experience Cloud]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Enable Co-Branding]**.
1. Browse to upload the image, then click **[!UICONTROL Save.]**

   For best results when viewing the image in a browser, upload a 100px by 30px image. For best results in PDF output, upload a 417px by 125px (300 dpi) image. Oversized images are shrunk to size, while preserving aspect ratio. 

## Use segments with dashboards {#concept_ED030C3713D54D03971FB7B209285750}

Dashboards, like most reports in Adobe Analytics, can utilize segments to retrieve desired data.

<!-- 

segments_dashboards.xml

 -->

Segments can be applied on two levels: to an entire dashboard or on a specific reportlet.

* **Reportlet level**: Click **[!UICONTROL Layout]**, then the report suite of the reportlet you want to segment. A modal window appears that lets you add or change what segment(s) the reportlet uses. 

* **Dashboard level**: Click the Segment icon in the left navigation, check the segment(s) you want to use, and click Apply. The selected segments override and replace any reportlet-level segments.
