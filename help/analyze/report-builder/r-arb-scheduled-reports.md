# Scheduled Task Manager

Field descriptions for the Scheduled Task Manager.

The Scheduled Task Manager lets you see a list of existing scheduled reports, along with their recipients, schedule details, and file formats. It also lets you reactivate scheduled workbooks that failed to run.

   <td colname="col1"> <p>Reactivate </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>When a scheduled workbook fails to run, Report Builder attempts to run the workbook two more times every fifteen minutes. After three failed attempts, Report Builder deactivates the schedule and displays the <span class="wintitle"> Reactivate</span> button. When you reactivate a workbook, the scheduled delivery restarts from the time it became deactivated. </p> <p>For example, if a scheduled workbook was deactivated 14 days ago, and you reactivate it today, it runs for every missing day and will be delivered 14 times. If you do not want the workbook delivered for the missing days, you can delete the scheduled workbook and then create a new scheduled workbook using the same scheduling parameters. </p> <p> <p>Note:  You should not reactivate a workbook unless you know the reason the system deactivated it. One troubleshooting solution is to download a deactivated workbook, and refresh it on the client side. If you see no errors, you should be able to reactivate it. </p> </p> </td>
