# Dashboards and reportlets

A dashboard is a collection of thumbnail reports called reportlets. A dashboard is most useful when it contains related reportlets that give you complete overviews of certain aspects of your site, such as finding methods, visitor profiles, and so on.

## Dashboards and reportlets {#concept_8CD3ACA2830A4994A68A31D8773B57E0}

A dashboard is a collection of thumbnail reports called *`reportlets`*. A dashboard is most useful when it contains related reportlets that give you complete overviews of certain aspects of your site, such as finding methods, visitor profiles, and so on.

You can add most marketing reports to a dashboard, including graphically intense reports like the [!UICONTROL Fallout Report], [!UICONTROL Conversion Funnel Report], and the [!UICONTROL Pathfinder Report].

You can also set a dashboard as your landing page, share dashboards with other users, and schedule them for delivery. If you do not set a dashboard (or a bookmark) as a landing page, the [!UICONTROL My Recommended Reports] dashboard displays. **[!UICONTROL My Recommended Reports]** shows the **[!UICONTROL Key Metrics]** report plus your five most frequently viewed reports. It is dynamic and based on the actual reports that you view the most.

Be aware that some frequently viewed reports cannot be dashboarded and will not show up. These include:

* Anomaly Detection reports 
* Contribution Analysis reports 
* Fallout reports 
* Pathfinder reports 
* Real-time reports 
* Other dashboards

> [!NOTE] The **[!UICONTROL Site Overview]** dashboard is no longer listed in Reports & Analytics. However, there are still a couple of circumstances where you will see some or all of its reportlets.

* If you have, say, only three frequently viewed reports, Reports & Analytics will take two reports from the Site Overview dashboard to complete the **[!UICONTROL My Recommended Reports]** dashboard.
* Brand new report suites will also initially still feature the Site Overview reportlets, until they gets replaced by your frequently viewed reports. Even so, the dashboard will now be called **[!UICONTROL My Recommended Reports]**.

In addition to the dashboards you create, the following prepackaged dashboards are included for each user: 

**[!UICONTROL Components] > [!UICONTROL Dashboards] > [!UICONTROL Shared Dashboards] > [!UICONTROL Local Sites]**

This customizable dashboard provides you a way to drop reportlets into the template provided.

**[!UICONTROL Components] > [!UICONTROL Dashboards] > [!UICONTROL Shared Dashboards] > [!UICONTROL Site Operations Dashboard]**

This dashboard provides you an overview of key metrics related to your website operations. Reports on this dashboard include:

*   Exit Pages
*   Most Popular Pages
*   Most Popular Site Sections
*   KPI/Gauge Reportlet
*   Text Reportlet
*   Company Summary Reportlet

Use the [!UICONTROL Dashboard Manager] to edit and manage dashboards, and enable them for DirectAccess.

See [Managing Dashboards](/help/analyze/reports-analytics/dashboard-manage.md).

## Create a dashboard {#task_54EFBED59BDC4418A919E6EF84AB9CFF}

Before adding a report (as a reportlet) to a dashboard, define the dashboard's layout.

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Components]** > **[!UICONTROL Manage Dashboards]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Dashboard]**.
1. Type a name for the dashboard.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL 3 x 2]** or **[!UICONTROL 2 x 2]** to specify how many reportlets you want on the dashboard page.
1. Configure the dashboard page layout:

   * **[!UICONTROL Add Page]**: Adds a blank page to the dashboard, on which you can drag content to create reportlets.
   * **[!UICONTROL Paper]**: Lets you specify a paper size, such as landscape, portrait, and A4.
   * **[!UICONTROL Find Content]**: Lets you search for content in the [!UICONTROL Add Content] and [!UICONTROL Dashboard Contents] menus.

1. Add available content to the dashboard by dragging items to the reportlet canvas.

   See [Creating a Reportlet](/help/analyze/reports-analytics/dashboard.md#task_EC3AFBBAA51C45CEBAF632F841C305B3) and [Editing Dashboard Settings](/help/analyze/reports-analytics/dashboard.md#task_90D7FAC1CC3E4DB786B4C87CC33B5459).
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save.]**

   Saving a dashboard makes it available in the **[!UICONTROL Dashboard]** menu. The new dashboard is also available in the [!UICONTROL Dashboard Manager] ( **[!UICONTROL Favorites]** > **[!UICONTROL Dashboards]** > **[!UICONTROL Manager]**), where you can edit, organize, share, schedule, archive dashboards, and more. (See [Managing Dashboards](/help/analyze/reports-analytics/dashboard-manage.md).)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create New]**.

   The reportlet is added to the **[!UICONTROL Dashboard Contents]** menu in the dashboard editor.

## Add content to a dashboard {#task_90D7FAC1CC3E4DB786B4C87CC33B5459}

Steps that describe how to add content from other dashboards and shared dashboards. You can also add content from custom and external sources, such as text and images.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The current limit to the number of pages in a dashboard is 30.

   **Custom Reportlets**

   *Data Content:*

   *   Company Summary: Displays page views for multiple report suites and metrics that you select.
   *   Metric Gauge: Displays a gauge that tells you where your metrics figures are in relation to the thresholds you specify.
       
       You can select a metric, graph type, color range, and threshold values. If the count of the metric rises above the Greater Than threshold, the gauge indicates this in the reportlet, using the color above the Greater Than field. If the count of the metric is below the Less Than threshold, the gauge indicates this in the reportlet, using the color above the Less Than field. The values you specify in these fields is the countable value of the metric, such as number of page views, dollar amounts, cart views, and so on. (Do not use special characters.)
   *   Report Suite Summary: Displays a selected metric and its total or high and low values for a report suite.
   *   Usage Summary: Shows data on interface access by people in your organization. This reportlet can show data by username access, report access, or report suite access.
       You can create the following User Content reportlets by providing URLs. If an image or other resource URL does not begin with https://, Internet Explorer users might see a warning about mixed content. You can disable the warning for mixed content in your browser security settings.

   *User Content:*

   *   External Report: Lets you add an external report in .xml and .csv formats.
   *   HTML: Lets you add a custom HTML reportlet. The URL must use HTTP or HTTPS. Otherwise, you see a `Specified URL could not be retrieved` error. In the document's content, all tags with attributes using the data: and javascript: protocols are removed. Scripts, frames, applets, event handlers, flash, and other embedded objects are removed. If resources are specified using non HTTPS, IE users are issued a warning about mixed content.
   *   Image: Lets you create a dashboard from an image URL. If the URL uses the HTTP protocol, Internet Explorer issues a mixed content warning. Using a URL with HTTPS removes the warning. All other protocols issue a `Specified URL could not be retrieved` error.
   *   RSS: Lets you add an RSS web feed. Must be HTTP or HTTPS. Otherwise, you see a `Specified URL could not be retrieved` error.
   *   Text: Lets you use XHTML code to create your own data. Use HTTP or HTTPS for a URL. Images used in the text reportlet content that have the HTTP protocol result in IE users receiving a warning about mixed content. Images included using other protocols do not display in the reportlet.

   **My Dashboards**

   Lists your upgraded dashboards from which you can move content to the new dashboard.

   **Legacy Dashboards**

   Lists your shared dashboards from which you can move content to the new dashboard.

   **Shared Dashboards**

## Use segments with dashboards {#concept_ED030C3713D54D03971FB7B209285750}

Dashboards, like most reports in Adobe Analytics, can utilize segments to retrieve desired data.

<!-- 

segments_dashboards.xml

 -->

Segments can be applied on two levels: to an entire dashboard or on a specific reportlet.

* **Reportlet level**: Click **[!UICONTROL Layout]**, then the report suite of the reportlet you want to segment. A modal window appears that lets you add or change what segment(s) the reportlet uses.
* **Dashboard level**: Click the Segment icon in the left navigation, check the segment(s) you want to use, and click Apply. The selected segments override and replace any reportlet-level segments.
