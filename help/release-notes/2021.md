# 2021 Adobe Analytics release notes

This page is maintained throughout the month, so please check back regularly for updates to Adobe Analytics.

## November/December 2021 {#nov2021}

| Feature | Description | [General Availability](releases.md) - Target Date |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Minute-level date ranges in Analysis Workspace | You can apply a minute-level date range under the advanced settings of your panel calendar or when building a custom date range. If you are reporting on a date range that spans many days, start time applies to the first day and end time applies to the last day in your range. | October 18, 2021 |
| [!UICONTROL Media Playback Time Spent] | Adobe Streaming Media Playback [!UICONTROL Time Spent] provides valuable insight into viewer engagement and enables media organizations to derive deeper, more granular insights with minute-by-minute user engagement through advanced time spent analysis with day-parting capabilities. You can observe the amount of time spent viewing your media streams at a specific point in time. You can split the playback duration by different granularities, including new 5 minute, 15 minute, and 30-minute granularities.

| Quick [!UICONTROL Segment Builder] | Allows business users to quickly apply basic segments in a simplified, in-line project workflow. No need to go to the [!UICONTROL Segment Builder]. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/segments/quick-segments.html) | October 21, 2021 |
| Analysis Workspace search improvements | Left rail search 1) prioritizes exact matches above broad matches, in addition to continuing to account for component recency and relevancy. 2) It highlights matched characters to make search results more understandable. 3) It's easier to find classifications related to a dimension. 4) Finally, it supports wildcard (`*`) searching to more easily find specific components that you need. Note: Wildcard searching does not yet work at the dimension item level. | October 21, 2021 |
| Dark Theme | [Dark theme](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/user-preferences.html#dark-theme) is available as a display option. | October 21, 2021 |

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| EOL for Reports & Analytics | January 4, 2022 | Effective **December 31, 2023**, Adobe intends to discontinue Reports & Analytics and its accompanying reports and features. The reports, visualizations and underlying technology that power Reports & Analytics no longer meet Adobe's technology standards. Most Reports & Analytics features are available within [Analysis Workspace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.html). Since the release of Analysis Workspace in 2015, Reports & Analytics functionality and capabilities have been moved to Analysis Workspace and a threshold of workflow parity has been reached. [This notice](https://spark.adobe.com/page/6WnF8JK6IRDhf) explains the end-of-life process. |
| "Global + China" RDC Type | November 22, 2021 | "Global + China" is a new Regional Data Collection (RDC) type that simplifies routing of traffic for global customers using the [!UICONTROL China Performance Optimization Add-On Package]. In the past, you had to determine whether data should be routed to the China collection endpoint or one of the Global collection endpoints. Now you can choose this RDC **type** to let Adobe determine the optimal collection endpoint based on the geolocation of the user. |
| EOL for three Analytics API services | September 16, 2021| On **October 20, 2021**, the following Analytics Legacy API services reached their end-of-life date and were shut down. Any current integrations built using these services stopped working on that day.<ul><li>1.3 Analytics APIs</li><li>1.4 SOAP Analytics APIs</li><li>Legacy OAuth Authentication (OAuth and JWT)</li></ul>Adobe has provided a [Legacy API EOL FAQ](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/APIEOL.md?mv=email) to help answer your questions and provide guidance on how to proceed. API integrations that employ these services can migrate to the [1.4 Analytics REST APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis?mv=email) or the [2.0 Analytics APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis?mv=email). Legacy OAuth accounts can migrate to an [Adobe Developer](https://developer.adobe.com/console) Analytics integration account, which can be used to access both the 1.4 Analytics APIs and 2.0 Analytics APIs. |
| EOL for Full Processing in Data Sources | October 18, 2021 | On **January 31, 2022**, Adobe will end of life Full Processing, which enables users to ingest offline hit data into Analytics. This capability is available via [Bulk Data Insertion API](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experiencecloud/analytics/docs.html#!AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis/master/bdia.md).

### Important notices for [!DNL Analytics] administrators

| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Browser user agents reflect incorrect operating system versions for macOS | May 19, 2021 | All major browsers currently report users of macOS X 11 and above incorrectly as using macOS 10, as recorded in the browser's user agent string. This issue affects Adobe Analytics reporting, because it uses the user agent to determine device information like operating system. This inaccuracy is apparently in place to prevent compatibility issues for some websites. See this [Bugzilla ticket](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213622&utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=User+Agent+strings%2C+new+BigQuery+features%2C+custom+Google+Tag+Manager+loader...+%E2%80%93+Simmer+Newsletter+%2311%20-%205873454) for reference. It is not clear when or if this issue will be fixed.<br>Some browsers initially recorded macOS 11 correctly, so there may be some traffic matching this value. However, because of the inaccurate reporting, filtering for operating system macOS 11 is not useful.<br>This issue is significant because starting with Safari on macOS 11, Apple updated ITP cookie expiry limitations to apply to CNAME implementations (see [WebKit blog post](https://webkit.org/blog/11338/cname-cloaking-and-bounce-tracking-defense/)).<br>Before this update, these limitations applied only to client-side cookies set via JavaScript. This inaccuracy makes it difficult to assess how much traffic is using OS 11 and is thus impacted by the ITP change. You can learn more about cookies and Adobe Analytics [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/technotes/cookies/cookies.html#cookies). |

### Important notices for [!DNL Analytics] administrators

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Browser user agents reflect incorrect operating system versions for macOS | May 19, 2021 | All major browsers currently report users of macOS X 11 and above incorrectly as using macOS 10, as recorded in the browser's user agent string. This issue affects Adobe Analytics reporting, because it uses the user agent to determine device information like operating system. This inaccuracy is apparently in place to prevent compatibility issues for some websites. See this [Bugzilla ticket](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213622&utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=User+Agent+strings%2C+new+BigQuery+features%2C+custom+Google+Tag+Manager+loader...+%E2%80%93+Simmer+Newsletter+%2311%20-%205873454) for reference. It is not clear when or if this issue will be rectified.<br>Some browsers initially recorded macOS 11 correctly, so there may be some traffic matching this value. However, because of the inaccurate reporting, filtering for operating system macOS 11 is not useful.<br>This issue is significant because starting with Safari on macOS 11, Apple updated ITP cookie expiry limitations to apply to CNAME implementations (see [WebKit blog post](https://webkit.org/blog/11338/cname-cloaking-and-bounce-tracking-defense/)).<br>Before this update, these limitations applied only to client-side cookies set via JavaScript. This inaccuracy makes it difficult to assess how much traffic is using OS 11 and is thus impacted by the ITP change. You can learn more about cookies and Adobe Analytics [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/technotes/cookies/cookies.html#cookies). |

This fix allows users to address this problem by changing the settings for their ECID cookies.<br>Currently, Analytics sets [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud ID Service] (ECID) cookies with the setting `SameSite = Lax` which, prior to version 80 of Chrome, allowed cross-domain tracking. This is no longer the case. This change allows users to update the SameSite setting for ECID cookies to `None`.<br>This change allows the Analytics cookie to be shared in more situations, but Analytics cookies do not contain sensitive information. In addition, when choosing this setting, cookies must be set to `Secure` so that data can be passed only via HTTPS connections. If you would like to make this change, a supported user can open a ticket with Customer Care. |
