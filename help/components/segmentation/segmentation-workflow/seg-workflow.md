# Segmentation workflow overview

This article describes a suggested workflow to create segments with the Segment builder and manage segments through the Segment manager.


| Step | Action | Details | 
|:--:|---|---|
| 1 |  [Plan segments](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-plan.md) | Have you asked all the right questions before building segments and setting up a segment management environment? Have you designed the segment with its intended purpose and distinct usage in mind?. <br/>See the [Segment planning checklist](seg-plan.md) for help in planning and organizing your segments. |
| 2 | [Create segments](seg-create.md) | Use the various options available to create a new segment. |
| 3 | [Build segments](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-build.md) | Build and edit segments for use in all Analytics capabilities. <br/>See [Build Sequential Segments](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-sequential-build.md) for how to build segments with the THEN operator. |
| 4 | [ Tag segments](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-tag.md) | Tag segments for ease of organization and sharing. See how to plan and assign tags for simple and advanced searches and organization. |
| 5 | [ Approve segments](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-approve.md) | Approve segments to make them canonical. |
| 6 | [Use segments](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/t-seg-apply.md) | You can apply segments directly to a report, from the segment components. |
| 7 | [ Share segments](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/t-seg-share.md) | Share your segments with the intended audience in other Analytics tools and to Adobe Target and the Adobe Experience Cloud. | 
| 8 | [Filter segments](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/t-seg-filter.md) | Filter by tags, owners, and other filters (Show All, Mine, Shared With me, Favorites, and Approved.) |
| 9 |[Mark segment as favorites](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/t-seg-favorite.md) | Marking segments as favorites is another way to organize them for ease of use. |

## Manage segments

The [Segment Manager](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-manage.md) offers many ways of curating segments, such as sharing, filtering, tagging, approving, copying, deleting, and marking as favorites.
