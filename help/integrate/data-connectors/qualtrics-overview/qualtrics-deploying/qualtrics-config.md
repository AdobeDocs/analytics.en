# Enabling the Integration in Qualtrics Research Suite{#enabling-the-integration-in-qualtrics-research-suite}

After completing the integration wizard, you must activate the integration for each Qualtrics survey that you want connected.

1. Log in to the Qualtrics Research Suite.
1. On the **[!UICONTROL My Surveys]** tab, click the **[!UICONTROL Edit]** button for the survey that you want to integrate.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Advanced Options]** menu and select **[!UICONTROL Adobe Analytics]**. (if you do not see this option, ask your administrator about gaining the permissions required).

1. Select the Adobe Analytics Configuration, then click **[!UICONTROL Save]**. If no configurations are available then you likely have not yet completed the Adobe Integration Wizard.
   1. The **[!UICONTROL Include Partial Responses]** checkbox can be used to indicate that youâ€™d like to capture data into Adobe Analytics after each partial survey screen is completed. If not checked, then data is transferred only for fully completed surveys.
   1. The **[!UICONTROL Send Timestamp With Beacon]** checkbox should be used only when integrating with a Report Suite that is configured to receive time-stamped data (not common).
