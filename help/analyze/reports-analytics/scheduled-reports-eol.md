# End-of-life notice for scheduled reports

On April 21, 2022, we announced the deprecation of several features specific to scheduled reports in preparation for the previously announced [end of life for Reports & Analytics](https://express.adobe.com/page/6WnF8JK6IRDhf/). These features included the ability to schedule new reports as well as new data extracts. In response to customer requests seeking an extension and to ease the transition from Reports & Analytics, we have decided to extend access to these features until **Jan 31, 2023**. Please note that expiration windows for both reports and data extracts will continue to be limited to nine months; report and data extract delivery will pause at the end of this period unless the schedule is reactivated.

To reiterate, these features will be deprecated on January 31, 2023, prior to which you will need to migrate your scheduled reporting to one of the other mechanisms available to you in Adobe Analytics. 
 
Any scheduled reports still to be sent can be reactivated by simply logging into Analytics and opening the [!UICONTROL Scheduled Reports] manager. Click the **[!UICONTROL Edit]** icon and set a new scheduled time and expiration. Any report that gets reactivated will have a default expiration of 9 months, unless a shorter expiration date is chosen.
 
Any report with a creation date less than two years with no expiration date (or with an expiration date longer than two years) will have a default 9-month expiration date applied. The new expiration date will be December 15, 2022. You can edit this expiration date to be less than 9 months, but not greater.
 
Finally, any edits to an existing scheduled report with no expiration date require an expiration date of 9 months or less. Otherwise, you cannot save any edits or changes to the report.
 
At the time of expiration, the scheduled report will be paused. However, the report can be reactivated with a new 9-month expiration date. No reports or data will be deleted.

## New governance policy

The purpose of this action is to effectively manage and maintain our scheduled reports as we prepare for the previously announced end-of-life for Reports & Analytics. This will serve as our new governance policy moving forward: 

* No new scheduled reports can be created after January 31, 2023.
* After January 31, 2023, all scheduled reports have a maximum expiration date of 9 months. 
* After 9 months, expired tasks are paused and can be reactivated, if still needed, until December 31, 2023. 
* On December 31, 2023, Reports & Analytics will be deprecated.
* As of January 31, 2023, you can no longer set up new Data Extracts. Existing ones will continue to run, but no new ones can be scheduled.
