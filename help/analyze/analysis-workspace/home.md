Drag-and-drop any number of data tables, visualizations, and components (dimensions, metrics, segments, and time granularities) to a project. Instantly create breakdowns and segments, create cohorts for analysis, create alerts, compare segments, do flow and fallout analysis, and curate and schedule reports for sharing with anyone in your business. Advanced features include Attribution IQ,
