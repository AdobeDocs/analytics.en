# Calendar and date ranges overview

In the calendar, you can specify dates and date ranges, or select a preset.

Calendar selections apply at the panel level, but you have the option to apply them to all panels. By default, the Workspace calendar shows the current month and last month.

The first click starts a date range selection. Then highlight the range in either direction until the second click, which selects the end of the date range. If the `Shift` key is held down (or right-click is used) while clicking the first date, it will append to the range.

You can also drag dates (and time dimensions) into a Workspace project. You can select specific days, weeks, months, years, or a rolling date.

| Setting | Description |
|--- |--- |
|Selected Days|Selected days/weeks/months/years.|
|Use Rolling Dates|Rolling dates allow you to generate a dynamic report that looks forward or backward for a set period of time based on when you ran the report. For example, if you want to report on all Orders placed "Last Month" (based on the Created Date field) and ran that report in December, you'd see orders placed in November. If you ran that same report in January, you'd see orders placed in December.  Date Preview: Indicates what time period the rolling calendar encompasses.  Start: You can choose among current day, current week, current month, current quarter, current year.  End: You can choose among current day, current week, current month, current quarter, current year.  For an example, go [here](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/calendar-date-ranges/custom-date-ranges.md).|
|Date Range|Lets you pick a preset date range. Last 30 days is the default.|
|Apply to All Panels|Lets you not only change the selected date range for the current panel, but also for all other panels within the project.|
|Apply|Applies the date range to this panel only.|
