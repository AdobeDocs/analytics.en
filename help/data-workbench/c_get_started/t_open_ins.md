   The first time you start, the system displays the [!UICONTROL Start] page and begins downloading profile data and the data cache. 

1. After the data cache begins to fill, click **[!UICONTROL Start]**.

   The system displays the [!UICONTROL Worktop].

   The next time you start Data Workbench, the system skips the [!UICONTROL Start] page and displays the [!UICONTROL Worktop], unless a new profile has been added to the server.

   Updates to the profile and its data are downloaded only if you are working online and have a network connection to the Data Workbench server. For more information about working online, see [Working Offline and Online](../c_get_started/c_off_on.md#concept_CEF8758EDE044B18B3558376C5EB9F54).

   >[!NOTE]

   >It is not recommended for multiple users to share a single machine for using the Workstation.
