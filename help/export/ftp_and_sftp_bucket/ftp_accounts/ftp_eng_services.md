# Engineering Services Engagements with FTP

These engagements include [!UICONTROL  DB VISTA] and custom projects. 

For information on FTP limits and data retention, see [ FTP Limits and Data Retention](../../ftp_and_sftp_bucket/ftp_limits.md#concept_8CAA1D8F27B3411AB902520AD6C9A70E). 

## DB VISTA {#section_D1AC697356DA4B92B7A7F074ED76147F}

Similar to a SAINT upload via FTP, [!UICONTROL  DB VISTA] receives data through an FTP upload. For more information on file formats and the [!UICONTROL  DB VISTA] upload process, refer to the [!UICONTROL  DB VISTA] Introduction to [!UICONTROL  DB VISTA]white paper, which can be found in the Adobe Suite Help site by going to **[!UICONTROL  Supporting Docs]** > **[!UICONTROL  White Papers]**. 

## Custom Engagements {#section_A2A251CFB38D47CA9CDA73C5B00F5DDA}

Adobe Engineering Services offers custom projects that use both FTP and SFTP. See Adobe Engineering Services for more information on custom projects. For information on SFTP, see [ Secure File Transfer Protocol](../../ftp_and_sftp_bucket/ftp_sftp/ftp_sftp.md#concept_08905F69AE2445FFB167D8AEE68390DC).
