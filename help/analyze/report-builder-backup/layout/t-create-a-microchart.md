# Create a microchart

In the Custom Layout, you can turn a metric column into a bar chart with a corresponding percentage value, or a percentage value with a corresponding bar chart. The percentage value is the metric value or total for the overall non-filtered request for the period.

1. Create a request in Excel using the [Custom Layout](/help/analyze/report-builder/layout/configure-the-custom-layout.md).
1. Right click the metric value column.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Change Output Display]**, then the type of microchart and percent display you would like to see.

   Report Builder changes the display in the column to match your selection.
