The bullet graph features a single, primary measure (for example, current year-to-date revenue) and allows you to enter qualitative ranges performance ranges (for example, compared to a target revenue). You can specify high, medium, and low. You can specify goal ranges in [!UICONTROL Visualization Settings].
