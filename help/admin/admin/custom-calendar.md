>Changing the calendar changes the way data is processed (i.e. the definition of weekly and monthly unique visitors). When a calendar's definition of weeks and months changes, historical data is not altered.

You can use the calendar to define the first day of the week and year, or use a different retail calendar style. The calendar formats are used to for various purposes, including sales comparison and forecast standardization, payroll cost analysis, or physical inventory count regulation. For example, the retail industry uses the 4-5-4 accounting calendar to support selling season's particular to the retail industry. Each of the calendar formats is described below.

The number of weeks in each month depends on the selected first day of the year. </p> <p>A year has 52 weeks. Divide that into 4 quarters and you get 13 weeks per quarter. But there are 3 months in a quarter. 13 is not divisible by three so you end up putting the extra week into one of the months so that it's always consistent. 5/4/4 means the 1st month of the quarter has the extra week. 4/5/4 means the 2nd month has the extra week, etc. In the 5-4-4 calendar, the 53rd week is added onto the last quarter of the year. </p>
