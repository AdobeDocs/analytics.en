description: Determine file extensions that automatically get tracked as download links.

# linkDownloadFileTypes

When `trackDownloadLinks` is set to `true` and a visitor clicks on a link, AppMeasurement checks the URL of the link for filetype extensions. If the link URL contains a filetype found in `linkDownloadFileTypes`, a download link image request is automatically sent.

Use `linkDownloadFileTypes` to customize what file extensions you want to count as download links.

> [!NOTE] Only actual clicks are tracked automatically. The following types of links are not automatically tracked:
>
> * File downloads that start automatically when a page loads
> * Downloads that trigger after a redirect
> * Right-clicking and selecting 'Save Target As...'
> * Links that use JavaScript, such as `javascript:openLink()`
>
> For these download types, you can manually call the `tl()` function.

If a clicked link matches both exit link and download link criteria, the download link type takes priority.

## Download Extensions in Adobe Experience Platform Launch

Download Extensions is a list of file extensions with a field to add more under the [!UICONTROL Link Tracking] accordion when configuring the Adobe Analytics extension.

1. Log in to [launch.adobe.com](https://launch.adobe.com) using your AdobeID credentials.
2. Click the desired property.
3. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click the [!UICONTROL Configure] button under Adobe Analytics.
4. Expand the [!UICONTROL Link Tracking] accordion, which reveals the [!UICONTROL Download Extensions] field.

Add file extensions to the list by entering text in the field and clicking [!UICONTROL Add]. Remove file extensions from the list by clicking their respective X icon.

## s.linkDownloadFileTypes in AppMeasurement and Launch custom code editor

The `s.linkDownloadFileTypes` variable is a string of comma-separated file extensions. Do not use spaces.

If this variable is not defined, automatic download link tracking does not work (even if `trackDownloadLinks` is `true`).

```js
s.linkDownloadFileTypes = "doc,docx,eps,jpg,png,svg,xls,ppt,pptx,pdf,xlsx,tab,csv,zip,txt,vsd,vxd,xml,js,css,rar,exe,wma,mov,avi,wmv,mp3,wav,m4v"
```
