# Streaming media services quality dimensions

*This page describes the available dimensions when you enable [!UICONTROL Media Quality] for a report suite. See [Streaming media services quality metrics](../metrics/sm-quality.md) for available metrics.*

Streaming media services quality dimensions provide reporting related to the quality of the content that the visitor consumes. Use of these dimensions require the [!UICONTROL Adobe Analytics for Streaming Media Ad-on]. Contact your Adobe Account Team for details.

When you enable **[!UICONTROL Media Quality]** under [Media reporting](/help/admin/tools/manage-rs/edit-settings/media-management.md), the following dimensions are available:

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Average bitrate | The average bitrate, in 100-KBPS bucket intervals. It is computed as a weighted average of all bitrate values in relation to the play duration for a given playback session. | Media Close | `a.media.qoe.bitrateAverageBucket` |
| Bitrate changes | The number of bitrate changes that happened during a playback session.| Media Close | `a.media.qoe.bitrateChangeCount` |
| Buffer events | The number of times that the media player entered a buffer state during a playback session. | Media Close | `a.media.qoe.bufferCount` |
| Total buffer duration | The total amount of time spent buffering, in seconds. | Media Close | `a.media.qoe.bufferTime` |
| Dropped frames | The total number of dropped frames that happened during a playback session. | Media Close | `a.media.qoe.droppedFrameCount` |
| Errors | The total number of errors that happened during a playback session. | Media Close | `a.media.qoe.errorCount` |

| Player SDK error IDs | All unique error IDs that are generated by the content player SDK. You must provide the desired error codes or IDs. Multiple error IDs are allowed. | Media Close | `a.media.qoe.playerSdkErrors` |
| Time to start | This value defaults to `0` if it is not set through the QoSObject. Set the value in milliseconds. Analysis Workspace reports this dimension in seconds. | Media Start, Media Close | `a.media.qoe.timeToStart` |
