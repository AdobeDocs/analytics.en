# Create more than one copy of a request

You can create more than one copy of an original request by filling a selected area of cells with as many copies of the request that will fit.

1. Select the request, then click **[!UICONTROL Copy Requests]**.
1. Select as many blank cells necessary, then click [!DNL Paste Requests].

   Report Builder fills the paste region with as many copies of the original requests as will fit, as long as the requests do not overlap the edge of the spreadsheet, or no requests already exist in the paste region selected.
