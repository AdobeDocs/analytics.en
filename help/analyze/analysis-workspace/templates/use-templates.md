# Use templates

Templates (or company templates) in Analysis Workspace provide quick insights into the most common reporting scenarios. Following are some examples of questions that you can answer with templates:

* How many people visit your site 
* How many of those visitors are unique visitors (counted only once) 
* How they came to the site (such as whether they followed a link or came there directly) 
* What keywords visitors used to search site content 
* How long visitors stayed on a given page or on the entire site 
* What links visitors clicked, and when they left the site 
* Which marketing channels are most effective at generating revenue or conversion events 
* How much time they spent watching a video 
* Which browsers and devices they used to visit your site

The following information describes how to access and use templates from the [!UICONTROL Templates] tab in Analysis Workspace.

## Access and run a template

1. In Analysis Workspace, select the [!UICONTROL **Workspace**] tab.

   <!--update screenshot -->

   ![Reports tab](assets/view-prebuilt-templates.png)

1. In the [!UICONTROL **Templates**] section, select either of the following tabs:

   * **[!UICONTROL Adobe templates]**: Shows all templates provided by Adobe.

   * **[!UICONTROL _login_company_name_ templates]**: Shows all company templates that have been created for your organization.

     Company templates can be created only by an administrator. For more information about how to create a company template, see [Create and manage templates](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/reports/create-company-reports.md).

1. Use either of the following options to change how you view the available templates:

   * Choose whether to view templates in a column view or a card view by selecting either the column view ![column view icon](assets/column-view-icon.png) or the card view ![card view icon](assets/card-view-icon.png) icon.

   * When using the card view ![card view icon](assets/card-view-icon.png), choose from the following sort orders: **[!UICONTROL Most recently used]**, **[!UICONTROL Most popular]**, **[!UICONTROL Alphabetical]**, **[!UICONTROL Categorical]**.   

1. In the search field, begin typing the name of the template you want to find, then select it from the list of templates. You can also search the template list by prop, eVar, and event number. <!-- still true? -->

   Or

   Select the category of template that you want to view, then select the template from the list of templates.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >To navigate the menu using the arrow keys, press the Forward Slash key (/), and then press the Down Arrow key. Press Enter to load the selected template.

   For a list of templates that are available, see the [Available templates](#available-reports) section below.

## Create a project based on a template {#use-reports}

A template might not fit your needs exactly, but it can get you close. In these cases, you can use the template as a starting point, then customize it to best suit your specific purposes. 

If you navigate away from a template after making changes, you are prompted to save or discard your changes. Saving changes to a template saves the template as a new project.

To customize a template and save it as a project:

1. In Adobe Analytics, select the [!UICONTROL **Workspace**] tab.

1. Select the [!UICONTROL **Templates**] tab.

1. Select the template you want to view. For example, under [!UICONTROL **Most popular**], select the [!UICONTROL **Pages**] template.

   ![Pages report](assets/pages-report.png)

1. The Pages template, as displayed in Analysis Workspace, shows two [visualizations](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-analysis-visualizations.md) ([Bar chart](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/bar.md) and [Summary number](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/summary-number-change.md)) and a [Freeform table](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/freeform-table.md). The metric used is Occurrences.
1. Do any of the following:

   * View the template.
   * Drag one or more segments into the Segment drop zone at the top. For example, drag the segment [!UICONTROL **Mobile Customers**] and view the results. 
   * Change the date range by going to the calendar at the top-right.
   * Add dimension breakdowns, drag in other metrics, and generally customize the template to suit your needs.

1. (Optional) Save the template as a project by selecting [!UICONTROL **Project**] > [!UICONTROL **Save**].

   The template is saved as a new project; it does not modify the existing template. For more information about saving projects, see [Save projects](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/save-projects.md).

## Available templates

To access all available pre-built templates:

1. In Adobe Analytics, select the [!UICONTROL **Workspace**] tab, then select the [!UICONTROL **Templates**] tab.

   Pre-built templates are organized by category. 

   <!--add screenshot-->

1. Select a category to view the templates within it.

   The following sections correspond to the available categories and provide information about each template.
   
   * [[!UICONTROL **Most popular**]](#most-popular)

   * [[!UICONTROL **Engagement**]](#engagement)
