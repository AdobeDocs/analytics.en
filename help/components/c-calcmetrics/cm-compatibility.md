# Metric compatibility

Explains the three Product Compatibility options.

When you create calculated or advanced calculated metrics in the Calculated Metric Builder, your metric will show as compatible with 1 or more options: Current Data, Fully Processed Data, or Marketing Channel Reports.

| Compatible with | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Current Data](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/reports-analytics/current-data.html) | The [!UICONTROL Include Current Data] option in Adobe Analytics lets you view the latest Analytics data, often before data is fully processed and finalized. [!UICONTROL Current Data] displays most metrics within minutes, providing actionable data for quick decision making. [!UICONTROL Current Data] supports calculated metrics only (those that include multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction.) [!UICONTROL Current Data] does not support advanced calculated metrics (that contain segments or functions). |
| Fully Processed Data | Data that is fully processed and includes segments and classifications. If you would rather view all metrics after the data is fully processed, you can disable [!UICONTROL Current Data] by removing users from the Current Data Users group. |
| Marketing Channel Reports | Metrics with first-touch allocation are compatible only with Marketing Channel reports. |
