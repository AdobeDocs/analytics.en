# pageURL

AppMeasurement automatically collects the page URL in each hit. If you want to override the page URL automatically collected by AppMeasurement, you can use this variable. You do not need to set this variable in most cases.

> [!NOTE] This variable is not an available dimension in Analysis Workspace. It is only available in Data Warehouse and Data Feeds. If you would like to use page URL as a dimension in Analysis Workspace, consider passing the `pageURL` variable into an eVar on every hit.

Sometimes URLs are longer than 255 bytes. AppMeasurement uses the `g` query string parameter for the first 255 bytes of the URL in image requests. If a URL is longer than 255 bytes, the rest of the URL is stored in the `-g` query string parameter. Protocol and query strings in the URL are included in this variable.

## Page URL in Adobe Experience Platform Launch

Launch automatically populates page URL. However, you can set the page URL override either while configuring the Analytics extension (global variables) or under rules.

1. Log in to [launch.adobe.com](https://launch.adobe.com) using your AdobeID credentials.
2. Click the desired property.
3. Go to the [!UICONTROL Rules] tab, then click the desired rule (or create a rule).
4. Under [!UICONTROL Actions], click an existing [!UICONTROL Adobe Analytics - Set Variables] action or click the '+' icon.
5. Set the [!UICONTROL Extension] dropdown to Adobe Analytics, and the [!UICONTROL Action Type] to [!UICONTROL Set Variables].
6. Locate the [!UICONTROL Page URL] section.

You can set page URL to any string value.

## s.pageURL in AppMeasurement and Launch custom code editor

The `s.pageURL` variable is a string that contains the URL of the page. AppMeasurement automatically collects this variable, however you can override its value if desired.

```js
s.pageURL = "https://example.com";
```

If you would like to use page URL as a dimension in reports, consider using the following in your implementation:

```js
// Set eVar1 to page URL without protocol or query strings
s.eVar1 = window.location.hostname + window.location.pathname;
```
