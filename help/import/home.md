# Analytics Import Guide

![Banner](../../assets/doc_banner_import.png)

This guide explains how to get data into Analytics. It includes:

* **[Data Sources](c-data-sources/datasrc-home.md)**: Upload a file to a designated Adobe FTP site. Adobe retrieves the file and includes the data in your report suite.
* **[Data Insertion API](c-data-insertion-api/c-data-insertion-api.md)**: Send data directly to Adobe's data collection through an API.
* **[Data Connectors](data-connectors/getting-started-data-connectors.md)**: Work with a supported 3rd party to bring their data into Adobe Analytics to enrich your report suite.
