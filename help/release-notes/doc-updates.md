Additionally, this feature offers:<ul><li>**Preview**: You can preview the format of a table before spending time to render real data.</li><li>**Flexible Row and breakdown settings**: You can set your row and breakdown levels for every dimension row. Previously, Workspace imposed defaults that could not be changed until after the data was returned.</li><li>**Breakdown by position**: You can set dimension rows to always _breakdown by position_ instead of _by specific item_ (the default).</li><li>**Manual static row ordering**: You can manually order static rows so that the table rows are displayed exactly as you need them. Previously, static rows could be sorted only by a metric column or alphabetically.</li></ul> |
