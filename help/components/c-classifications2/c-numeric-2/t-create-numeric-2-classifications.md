# Create numeric 2 classifications

You create numeric 2 classifications the same way you create other classifications. You can add numeric 2 classifications only to conversion or channel variables.

> [!NOTE] In the May 10, 2018, Analytics Maintenance release, Adobe started to limit the functionality of date-enabled and numeric classifications. These classification types were removed from the Admin and Classification Importer interfaces. No new date-enabled and numeric classifications can be added. Existing classifications can still be managed (uploaded to, deleted) through the standard classification workflow, and will continue to be available in reporting.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Report Suites]**.
1. Select the report suite, then click **[!UICONTROL Edit Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Conversion]** > **[!UICONTROL Conversion Classifications]**.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Add Classification]** icon.
1. Fill in the fields:

   **Select Type:** Select **[!UICONTROL Numeric 2]**.

   **Name:** Specify a name for the classification.
