# Protected worksheet elements

When you lock cells to protect your worksheet, you cannot create, edit, or refresh requests. Remove all protection from your worksheet before using Request Manager.

If you refresh the request and attempt to edit a cell during the refresh request process, an Excel toast is displayed to indicate that the spreadsheet is currently protected. After a refresh request process is complete, you can access the spreadsheet and the temporary spreadsheet protection is removed.
