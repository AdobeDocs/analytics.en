# Sort ascending or descending

Click on the columns names in the table header. The column shows the sort order by displaying a triangle icon in the table header. If the triangle is pointing down, sort order is descending (for alphanumeric data, 9-1 and Z-A), while if pointing up, the sort order is ascending (for alphanumeric data, 1-9 and A-Z). 

The default sort order is ascending.
