# Create folders in the user profile

Steps to create a new folder in the User Profile.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Creating folders might affect what appears in your menus. For more information about altering your menu structures, see [Customizing Menus](../../c_intf_anlys_ftrs/c_ctm_menus/c_ctm_menus.md#concept_93D4C09CB7F34CD293B7B64FBA1CF894).

1. Right-click in the [!UICONTROL User] column for the directory in which you want to create a new folder and click **[!UICONTROL Create]** > **[!UICONTROL Folder]**.
1. (Optional) To add an [!DNL order.txt] file to this folder, right-click in the **[!UICONTROL User]** column for the new folder and click **[!UICONTROL Create]** > **[!UICONTROL order.txt]**.

   For more information about using the [!DNL order.txt] file to control the appearance of your menus, see [Customizing Menus](../../c_intf_anlys_ftrs/c_ctm_menus/c_ctm_menus.md#concept_93D4C09CB7F34CD293B7B64FBA1CF894).

   You now can add local files to this folder. When you publish the local files that you create in this folder to your working profile, this folder is automatically saved there as well. For more information about publishing files, see [Publishing Files to Your Working Profile](../../c_admin_intrf/c_prof_mgr/t_pub_files_wkg_prof.md#task_A0106E010C834D16BD60EEF4721B6AF9).
