# Top Level Domains

Displays how customers from different countries impacted your success metrics. This dimension identifies world regions that visitors come from based on their originating domain extension.

 The originating domain refers to the domain through which the user is browsing the web (meaning, the ISP), rather than the referring domain that brought the user to your site. Domains ending in Commercial (.com), Network (.net), Education (.edu), Government (.gov) and Organization (.org) are usually based in the United States, and are listed separately from the rest of the countries.

All other countries have specific domain extensions, such as Brazil (.br) and the United Kingdom (.gb). Marketing reports recognize all country extensions. You can use this report to help you to tailor content on your site to people from the countries that generate the majority of your revenue and to decide if you need to create different instances of your entire site.
