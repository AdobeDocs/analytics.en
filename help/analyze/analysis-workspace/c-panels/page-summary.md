# Page summary panel

The [!UICONTROL Page summary] panel started out as a report in Reports & Analytics, under Reports > Engagement > Page analysis > Page summary. It is now a Workspace panel as well. This panel lets you easily explore key statistics about specific pages.

You can access the panel from within [!UICONTROL Reports] or within [!UICONTROL Workspace].

| Access point | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [!UICONTROL Reports] | <ul><li>The panel is already dropped into a project.</li><li>The left rail is collapsed.</li><li>Only the Page dimension is supported.</li><li>A default setting has already been applied, in this case the top visited page for the[!UICONTROL Page] dimension. You can modify this setting.</li></ul> |
| Workspace | Create a new project and select the Panel icon in the left rail. Drag the [!UICONTROL Page summary] panel above the Freeform table. Notice that the Page [!UICONTROL Dimension Item] field is left blank. Select a dimension item from the drop-down list. |
