# Mobile Views

The number of times a page is viewed or a dimension is set when accessed via a mobile device. Ad hoc analysis only.

> [!NOTE] This report was decommissioned with the maintenance release of September 21, 2017 and is no longer expected to return data or be available in reporting.

Instead of the mobile views metric, we recommend applying the "Visits from Mobile Devices" segment.
