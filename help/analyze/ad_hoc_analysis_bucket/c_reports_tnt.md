# Adobe Target

## Adobe Target {#topic_EBC899DB84A84780A1B8EE95C6C4CF18}
>View and segment your Adobe Target traffic data in an Analytics report.Examples include: 


* Measuring the success of Adobe Target campaigns through your Analytics KPIs. 

* Breaking down Target campaign and recipe data with Analytics conversion variables. 

* Breaking down other Reports and Analytics reports with Target campaign and recipe traffic data. 



By leveraging data in Reports and Analytics, you can drill into your Target recipes using breakdowns and detect high performing segments that are ideal for future tests and potentially targeted campaigns. The Reports and Analytics report displays conversion data rather than Target's conversion data. 

See the [ Adobe Target](https://help.testandtarget.omniture.com/) help system for more information.
