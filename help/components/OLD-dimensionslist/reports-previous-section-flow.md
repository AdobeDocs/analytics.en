# Previous Section Flow

The Previous Section Flow report is similar to the Previous Page Flow report. It displays data for Site Sections (groups of related web pages). If a page is contained in more than one site section, then the report displays data for all site sections.

 For example, an online retailer might have site sections for its products and site sections for product brands. In this case, a product web page can fall under multiple sight sections. Though a product page has only been viewed once, the Previous Section Flow report shows a page view for each sight section associated with the page.
