# Mobile attributes lookup

Mobile attributes show properties of the mobile device in the hit. This file appears when:

* Dynamic lookups are enabled. A support delegate in your organization can contact Customer Care with the desired feed ID to enable dynamic lookups.
* The `mobile_id` column is included.
* The `user_agent` column is excluded. This exclusion is required due to licensing agreements with DeviceAtlas.
