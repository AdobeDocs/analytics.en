# Current Adobe Analytics release notes (February 2023)

**Last update**: February 9, 2023

Adobe Analytics releases operate on a [continuous delivery model](releases.md) which allows for a more scalable, phased approach to feature deployment. Accordingly, these release notes get updated several times a month. Please check them regularly.

[Learn more](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/calendar-date-ranges/calendar.md#formula-relative-dates)</li></ul> | N/A |  February 8, 2023 |
| **Row/column filtering for Adobe Analytics Source Connector streaming** | The Analytics Source Connector in Adobe Experience Platform now allows for filtering of Analytics data which is used to populate profiles in [Real-Time Customer Profile](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/profile/home.html?lang=en). Row-level filtering helps reduce the number of events associated with profiles. Column level-filtering helps reduce the richness of the events themselves, thus enabling you to optimize the use of profile entitlements. This filtering applies only to data sent to Real-Time Customer Profile and [Identity Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/identity/home.html?lang=en). **Filtering does not impact the data which is sent to Data Lake for use in applications such as Customer Journey Analytics**.

## Important notices for Adobe Analytics administrators

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **Automatic migration to Classification Set architecture** | February 8, 2023 | Over the next several months, Adobe plans to migrate all classifications across all organizations to the latest classification architecture. The last customers to migrate is estimated to happen in May 2023. No customer action is required, and no down time is expected. This new architecture has many benefits, including:<ul><li>Significantly reduced processing time (72 hours â†’ 24 hours)</li><li>The ability to use the [Classification Sets](/help/components/classifications/sets/overview.md) UI</li><li>The option to use classification data in Adobe Experience Platform in the future through the [Adobe Analytics source connector for classification data](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sources/connectors/adobe-applications/classifications.html)</li></ul>Note the following changes that can potentially impact your organization's workflow:<ul><li>When using the browser import, '[!UICONTROL Overwrite on conflict]' is always enabled.</li><li>When using the browser import, the option to export immediately after import is no longer supported.</li><li>The Analytics 2.0 API `GetDimensions` endpoint now returns string identifiers for classifications instead of numeric identifiers. Numeric identifiers can still be used, but Adobe recommends using the new string identifiers where possible. Numeric identifiers can be retrieved by using the `?expansion=hidden` query string parameter.</li></ul>Contact Adobe Customer Care if you want a more specific migration schedule for your organization, or have questions/concerns around this migration. [Learn more](/help/components/classifications/sets/overview.md) |
| **Update to device lookups due to Google Client Hints** | January 25, 2023 | The use of client hints in device lookup will start on **February 16, 2023**. <p> <p>As of October 2022, it is possible to collect client hints with either the Web SDK or AppMeasurement JavaScript libraries. But client hints will not be incorporated into device lookup until February 2023. At that time, Adobe will begin using client hints in addition to the User-Agent when deriving certain device information for hits coming from Chromium browsers, such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. This is in response to Google's plan to gradually reduce the information presented from the User-Agent string in lieu of data passed via client hints. <p> <p>As part of this change, Adobe will use Device Atlas for all device lookups related to User-Agent.
