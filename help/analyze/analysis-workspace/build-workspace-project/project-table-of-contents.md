# Project table of contents

A table of contents is available within each project. This allows you to quickly jump between panels and visualizations within the project. This is especially useful when viewing larger projects that contain many panels and visualizations.

To view the table of contents on a project:

1. In Analysis Workspace, go to the project where you want to view the table of contents.

1. In the left nav, select the table of contents icon ![toc icon](assets/toc-icon.png). 

   The table of contents for the project is displayed and is expanded.

1. Click a section within the table of contents to jump to a panel or visualization within the project.
