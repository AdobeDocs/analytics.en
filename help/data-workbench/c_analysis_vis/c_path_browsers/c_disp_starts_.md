# Display the start and end of paths

You can display the starts and ends of paths in the path browser.

 For example, if your path browser shows the sequence of pages for each session, you might see Start of Session or End of Session nodes among the pages. The Start of Session node identifies the first page viewed during a particular session, which indicates that there were no previous page views in that session. The End of Session node identifies the last page viewed in a particular session, which indicates that there were no subsequent page views in that session.

**To enable or disable the display of starts and ends**

* Right-click the top border of the path browser and click **[!UICONTROL Display]** > *< **[!UICONTROL Group dimension name]**>* **[!UICONTROL starts and ends]**. When enabled, an X appears to the left of *Group dimension name* starts and ends.

For example, if your path browser shows the sequence of pages for each session, you would choose to display Session starts and ends.
