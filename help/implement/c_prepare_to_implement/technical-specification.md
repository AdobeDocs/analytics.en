# Technical specification

Your Adobe Consultant will discuss the technical specifications of your implementation with you.

It can be useful for you to be familiar with the content of the [Technical Specifications](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/implement/files/Tech Spec - Template - 05-05-2015.docx) document used by Consulting, although it is not required for you to know this information if you are working with a Consultant. This document is used as the standard guide for deploying Adobe Analytics on a given site. The document is divided into different sections, each of which describes a different component of the overall Analytics solution.

The industry specific Tech Specs cover the fundamental solutions and can be leveraged as a starting point for creating a more complete document.â€‹
