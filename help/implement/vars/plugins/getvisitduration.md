# Adobe plug-in: getVisitDuration

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This plug-in is provided by Adobe Consulting as a courtesy to help you get more value out of Adobe Analytics. Adobe Customer Care does not provide support with this plug-in, including installation or troubleshooting. If you require help with this plug-in, contact your organization's Account Manager. They can arrange a meeting with a consultant for assistance.

The `getVisitDuration` plug-in tracks the amount of time in minutes that the visitor has been on the site up to that point. Adobe recommends using this plug-in if you want to track cumulative time on the site up to that point, or to track the time it takes to perform an activity. This plug-in does not track the amount of time between events; if this functionality is desired, use the [`getTimeBetweenEvents`](gettimebetweenevents.md) plug-in.

<!--## Install the plug-in using the Web SDK or the Adobe Analytics extension

Adobe offers an extension that allows you to use most commonly-used plug-ins.

1. Log in to [Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](https://experience.adobe.com/data-collection) using your AdobeID credentials.
1. Click the desired tag property.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click on the [!UICONTROL Catalog] button
1. Install and publish the [!UICONTROL Common Analytics Plugins] extension
1. If you haven't already, create a rule labeled "Initialize Plug-ins" with the following configuration:
    * Condition: None
    * Event: Core – Library Loaded (Page Top)
1. Add an action to the above rule with the following configuration:
    * Extension: Common Analytics Plugins
    * Action Type: Initialize getVisitDuration
1. Save and publish the changes to the rule.-->

## Install the plug-in using custom code editor

If you do not want to use the plug-in extension, you can use the custom code editor.

1. Log in to [Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](https://experience.adobe.com/data-collection) using your AdobeID credentials.
1. Click on the desired property.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click the **[!UICONTROL Configure]** button under the Adobe Analytics extension.
1. Expand the [!UICONTROL Configure tracking using custom code] accordion, which reveals the [!UICONTROL Open Editor] button.
1. Open the custom code editor and paste the plug-in code provided below into the edit window.
1. Save and publish the changes to the Analytics extension.

## Install the plug-in using AppMeasurement

Copy and paste the following code anywhere in the AppMeasurement file after the Analytics tracking object is instantiated (using [`s_gi`](../functions/s-gi.md)). Preserving comments and version numbers of the code in your implementation helps Adobe with troubleshooting any potential issues.

```js
/******************************************* BEGIN CODE TO DEPLOY *******************************************/
/* Adobe Consulting Plugin: getVisitDuration v2.1 */
function getVisitDuration(){if(arguments&&"-v"===arguments[0])return{plugin:"getVisitDuration",version:"2.1"};var d=function(){if("undefined"!==typeof window.s_c_il)for(var c=0,b;c<window.s_c_il.length;c++)if(b=window.s_c_il[c],b._c&&"s_c"===b._c)return b}();"undefined"!==typeof d&&(d.contextData.getVisitDuration="2.1");window.cookieWrite=window.cookieWrite||function(c,b,f){if("string"===typeof c){var h=window.location.hostname,a=window.location.hostname.split(".").length-1;if(h&&!/^[0-9.]+$/.test(h)){a=2<a?a:2;var e=h.lastIndexOf(".");if(0<=e){for(;0<=e&&1<a;)e=h.lastIndexOf(".",e-1),a--;e=0<e?h.substring(e):h}}g=e;b="undefined"!==typeof b?""+b:"";if(f||""===b)if(""===b&&(f=-60),"number"===typeof f){var d=new Date;d.setTime(d.getTime()+6E4*f)}else d=f;return c&&(document.cookie=encodeURIComponent(c)+"="+encodeURIComponent(b)+"; path=/;"+(f?" expires="+d.toUTCString()+";":"")+(g?" domain="+g+";":""),"undefined"!==typeof cookieRead)?cookieRead(c)===b:!1}};window.cookieRead=window.cookieRead||function(c){if("string"===typeof c)c=encodeURIComponent(c);else return"";var b=" "+document.cookie,a=b.indexOf(" "+c+"="),d=0>a?a:b.indexOf(";",a);return(c=0>a?"":decodeURIComponent(b.substring(a+2+c.length,0>d?b.length:d)))?c:""};d=(new Date).getTime();var k=cookieRead("s_dur"),a=0;if(isNaN(k)||18E5<d-k)k=d;a=d-k;cookieWrite("s_dur",k+"",30);if(0===a)return"first hit of visit";a=Math.floor(a/6E4);return 0===a?"less than a minute":1===a?"1 minute":a+" minutes"};
/******************************************** END CODE TO DEPLOY ********************************************/
```

## Use the plug-in

The `getVisitDuration` function does not use any arguments. It returns one of the following values:

* `"first hit of visit"`
* `"less than a minute"`
* `"1 minute"`
* `"[x] minutes"` (where `[x]` is the number of minutes passed since the visitor landed on the site)

This plug-in creates a first-party cookie called `"s_dur"`, which is the number of milliseconds elapsed since the visitor landed on the site. The cookie expires after 30 minutes of inactivity.

## Examples

```js
// Always sets eVar10 to the number of minutes passed since the visitor first landed on the site
s.eVar10 = getVisitDuration();

// Checks if the events variable contains the purchase event.
// If it does, sets eVar56 to the number of minutes between the start of the visit and the time of purchase
if(inList(s.events, "purchase")) s.eVar56 = getVisitDuration();
```
