# Adobe Analytics landing page

The landing page for Adobe Analytics brings together both [!DNL Analysis Workspace] and [!DNL Reports & Analytics] in a single interface and access point under the [!DNL Workspace] umbrella. It features a project manager home page, an updated reports menu, modernized reports, and a learning section to help you with getting started more effectively. Here is a video overview:

{style="table-layout:auto"}

## Top menu structure {#top-menu}

![Top menu](assets/top-menus.png)

* Top Analytics menu: Most reports are now in the [!UICONTROL Reports] menu in the left rail.
* The left rail has three tabs: [!UICONTROL Projects], [!UICONTROL Reports], and [!UICONTROL Learning].

### Terminology 

* **[!UICONTROL Projects]** are customized designs that combine data components, tables, and visualizations that you built or that someone else built and shared with you. [!UICONTROL Projects] also refers to blank projects and blank mobile scorecards.
* **[!UICONTROL Reports]** refers to anything that was pre-built by Adobe, such as reports in Reports & Analytics and templates in Workspace.
* **[!UICONTROL Templates]** is no longer used as a term for Adobe's pre-built Workspace projects. They are now under [!UICONTROL Reports]. The term [!UICONTROL Templates] is still used for templates your company created.

## Navigate the [!UICONTROL Projects] tab {#navigate-projects}

[!UICONTROL Projects] serves as the [!UICONTROL Workspace] home page. The Projects tab displays the Company folder, any personal folders you created, your projects, and Mobile scorecards. Use this page to view, create, and modify folders, projects, and mobile scorecards. For more information, see [About Folders in Analytics](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/workspace-folders/about-folders.md).

![Landing all](assets/landing-all2.png)

### Deprecation of the Project Manager Page {#deprecate-pm-page}

With the release of the new landing page, we deprecated Project Manager as listed under the Components manager. The new landing page handles all of the functionality of the old Project Manager page and more. 
 
One common use case for the Project Manager page was to view all your projects. 

To view all of your projects on the new landing page by using the filter rail, select **OTHER FILTERS** and then select **Show all**. 

![Show all projects](assets/show-all-fIlter.png)

If you're in the "Folders & Projects" view, a modal will pop-up asking if you want to switch to the "All projects" view which makes it easier to view all of your projects outside of any folders that they may be organized in.   Select **Switch to "All projects" view** to better view all of the projects you have access to. 

![Switch to All projects](assets/switch-all-projects-view.png)

Another use case for Admins is to manage company reports in order to delete, rename, tag, or approve reports. For information about managing reports, see [Managing company reports](#manage-company-reports).

## Navigate the [!UICONTROL Reports] tab {#navigate-reports} 

The [!UICONTROL Reports] tab consolidates the following sets of reports:

* The pre-built [!UICONTROL Workspace] templates that were previously located under [!UICONTROL Workspace] > [!UICONTROL Project] > [!UICONTROL New]. Adobe no longer uses the word "template" in this context.
* Most of the pre-built reports under the previous Adobe Analytics [!UICONTROL Reports] top menu. These reports are now displayed in [Analysis Workspace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.html).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Consider the following when using reports:
>* Under Reports, a Favorites folder shows up only if you mark a new report as a favorite. No pre-existing Reports & Analytics favorites are carried forward.
>* Only the most commonly used reports that were formerly grouped in Reports & Analytics are available. A handful of rarely used or no-longer-relevant reports are no longer available. See the [Landing page FAQ](#landing-page-faq) below for more details.

### View and save a report {#use-reports}

If you navigate away from a report after making changes, you are prompted to save or discard your changes. Saving changes to a report saves the report as a new project.

1. Go to the [!UICONTROL **Reports**] tab.
1. Select the report you want to view. For example, under [!UICONTROL **Most popular**], select the [!UICONTROL **Pages**] report.

   ![Pages report](assets/pages-report.png)

1. The Pages report, as displayed in Analysis Workspace, shows two [visualizations](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-analysis-visualizations.md) ([Bar chart](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/bar.md) and [Summary number](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/summary-number-change.md)) and a [Freeform table](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/freeform-table.md). The metric used is Occurrences.
1. Do any of the following:

   * View the report.
   * Drag one or more segments into the Segment drop zone at the top. For example, drag the segment [!UICONTROL **Mobile Customers**] and view the results. 
   * Change the date range by going to the calendar at the top-right.
   * Add dimension breakdowns, drag in other metrics, and generally customize the report to suit your needs.

1. (Optional) Save the report as a project by selecting [!UICONTROL **Project**] > [!UICONTROL **Save**].

   This saves the report as a new project; it does not modify the existing report. For more information about saving a report as a project, see "Create a project from a blank project or a report" in [Create projects](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/create-projects.md).

### Create a custom company report {#company-report}

Custom reports created and saved for others in your login company to use, are called company reports. Previously created company reports and newly created company reports are listed in the Create Project modal as shown below.

To create a new Company report:

1. Build a project in Analysis Workspace to your desired state.
1. Select [!UICONTROL **Project**] > **[!UICONTROL Save as company report…]**.
   
   ![Company report](assets/company-report.png)

1. Update the name of the report, add a description, and add any tags, then select [!UICONTROL **Save as company report**]. 

   The report is added to the Company Reports list in the Create Project modal and is available to users in your login company. 

   For more information about how users can create a project based on a company report, see "Create a project from a blank project or a report" in [Create projects](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/create-projects.md).

More learning options:

* Notice that you have access to a 20-minute video overview of Analysis Workspace at the top left of any report you open.
* For new users, we recommend the [Training Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCH1Kl1q9Wk) video that walks you through building a new project.
* Here is a link to the [complete Analysis Workspace documentation](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.md).
* Here is the complete [YouTube playlist for Analysis Workspace](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2tCx83mn7GuNnQdYGOtlyCu0V5mEZ8sS).

### Manage company reports {#manage-company-reports}

Admins can filter the project list to display and manage company reports. Pinned items remain pinned followed by the list of company reports that are identified by the ![report icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_FileTemplate_18_N.svg) report icon . In this view, you can delete, rename, tag, or approve one or more reports.
