# Media management

You can enable media in Analytics to reserve a special set of Media Solution Variables for use in measurement and reporting. These variables behave like Custom Evars, Events, and Props, but do not count against your variable limits. After they are enabled, your users will see a new set of Media reports in the Analytics menus.
