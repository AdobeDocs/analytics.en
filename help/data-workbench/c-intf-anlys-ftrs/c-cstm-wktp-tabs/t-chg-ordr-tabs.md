# Change the tab order

Steps to change the order of the tabs that appear in the Worktop.

1. In the [!UICONTROL Profile Manager], click **[!UICONTROL Workspaces]** to view its contents.
1. In the *working profile name* column, right-click the check mark for the [!DNL Workspaces\order.txt] file and click **[!UICONTROL Make Local]** > **[!UICONTROL Yes]**.
1. Right-click the check mark for the [!DNL Workspaces\order.txt] file in the [!UICONTROL User] column and click **[!UICONTROL Open]** > **[!UICONTROL in Notepad]**.
1. Rename, delete, or add tab names exactly as you want them to appear in the [!UICONTROL Worktop]. For example, the following would result in the [!UICONTROL Getting Started] tab appearing first and the [!UICONTROL Acquisition] tab appearing last.

   Getting Started

   Dashboards

   Activity

   Acquisition 

1. Save and close the file.
1. (Optional) To make the change available to all users of the working profile, right-click the white check mark for the [!DNL Workspaces\order.txt] file in the [!UICONTROL User] column and click **[!UICONTROL Save to]** > *< **[!UICONTROL working profile name]**>*.
