# Transitioning from a third-party analytics platform to Adobe Analytics

This guide presents common report types that help you to learn core concepts and workflows in Adobe Analytics, focusing on key similarities and differences between Adobe and other popular tools. This guide is designed for analysts who are familiar with basic digital analytics concepts, but new to Adobe Analytics. It assumes that the organization has a working implementation that sends data to Adobe data collection servers. If your organization has not yet set up an Adobe Analytics implementation, start with the [Adobe Analytics First Admin Guide](/help/admin/admin-console/first-admin-guide.md).

Both Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics are powerful platforms to obtain valuable insights to your website performance. Each have their own processing architecture and user interface, giving each platform unique advantages. This guide is designed to help acclimate a user experienced with Google Analytics towards Adobe Analytics.

In Adobe Analytics, there are two main way to pull basics reports after logging in to the Adobe Experience Cloud:

* **Reports & Analytics** is the historical method to pulling basic reports. The left hand menu provides a list of prefabricated reports, and allows the user to navigate to a report they want and get data. Segments and metrics can provide additional customizations. Users who are experienced with Google Analytics reports might find this layout familiar.
* **Analysis Workspace** is the current recommended method to pull most reports. The left menu allows the user to drag and drop components to build their own report. It allows much more freedom to meet exact reporting needs. Users who are experienced with creating Google Analytics dashboards and custom reports might find this layout familiar.

Most reports can be created in both Reports & Analytics and Analysis Workspace. However, some reports can only be pulled using one platform or the other. In most cases, Adobe recommends using Analysis Workspace, unless a specific feature is only available in Reports & Analytics.

## Recommended learning path

Adobe recommends starting with the absolute basics of getting report data:

* [Create a basic report in Analysis Workspace for GA users](reports/create-report.md)

Once you are familiar with components in Analysis Workspace, you can learn how to recreate most reports using the right components.

* [Create Real-Time reports in Adobe Analytics](reports/realtime-reports.md)
* [Create Audience reports in Adobe Analytics](reports/audience-reports.md)
* [Create Acquisition reports in Adobe Analytics](reports/acquisition-reports.md)
* [Create Behavior reports in Adobe Analytics](reports/behavior-reports.md)
* [Create Conversions reports in Adobe Analytics](reports/conversions-reports.md)

After learning to pull reports, understanding [processing and architecture differences](processing-differences.md) can help reconcile the different numbers obtained between platforms. An [FAQ](faq.md) is also available.
