# Choose an implementation method

There are multiple ways to implement Adobe Analytics.

* [!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform Launch] (Recommended) 
* [!UICONTROL Dynamic Tag Management] 
* JavaScript

## [!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform Launch] {#section_AEEA6AFE2C8D4182BC778F08EA171DC8}

[!UICONTROL Experience Platform Launch] is the next generation of website tag and mobile SDK management capabilities from Adobe. [!UICONTROL Experience Platform Launch] gives you a simple way to deploy and manage all of the analytics, marketing, and advertising integrations necessary to power relevant customer experiences.

[!UICONTROL Experience Platform Launch] empowers anyone to build and maintain their own integrations with [!DNL Experience Platform Launch], called Extensions. These extensions are available to web and mobile [!UICONTROL Experience Platform Launch] customers in an app-store experience, so customers can quickly install, configure, and deploy their integrations.

For more information, see [Getting Started with Experience Platform Launch](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/getting-started).

## [!UICONTROL Dynamic Tag Management] {#section_22E3F3F928894A6A8D77E6953E6CA51C}

[!UICONTROL Dynamic Tag Management] automates much of the detail work required to implement [!DNL Analytics]. Enter the required information in a form-based interface, and [!DNL Dynamic Tag Management] generates the code you need to add to your pages.
It is useful to be familiar with JavaScript, and to understand basic Analytics terminology, such as

* What an [eVar](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/conversion_var_admin.html) is and how it works 
* When to use a [custom event](../../implement/analytics-terminology-basics/c-props-evars/event-custom.md#concept_CDA3C98C85B24A71B4B5C71F24BF918F)

For information about getting access to Dynamic Tag Management and getting up and running, see [Getting Started](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/dtm/get_started.html) in the Dynamic Tag Management Product Documentation.

For more information, see [Implementing Analytics with Dynamic Tag Management](../../implement/c-implement-with-dtm/dtm-implementation-overview.md).

## JavaScript {#section_55429940D5094B9BB513E526F224D1B4}

The JavaScript implementation method requires you to configure the JavaScript codes on your pages manually. Much of this effort can be simplified if you use the Expereience Platform Launch or the Dynamic Tag Management implementation methods. However, some users might require the JavaScript method.

The JavaScript implementation requires:

* Strong JavaScript skills 
* Solid understanding of Analytics concepts and terminology

For more information, see [Implementing Analytics Using JavaScript](../../implement/js-implementation/javascript-implementation-overview.md).
