# Implement Analytics for Mobile Devices

* **Adobe Experience Platform Launch:** The standardized and recommended method to implement Adobe Analytics. Place a loader tag on each page, and use Launch's interface to determine how each variable is defined.
* **Dynamic Tag Management:** The predecessor to Launch. DTM uses a similar interface to implement Analytics, but is no longer updated and is not as flexible. Adobe recommends using Launch for implementing Adobe Analytics.
* **Legacy JavaScript:** The historical manual method to implement Adobe Analytics. Outlines variables and settings used in an implementation, which can be useful for Launch implementations using rules with custom code.
