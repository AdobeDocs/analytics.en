# Adobe Analytics system requirements

Lists the system requirements to use various product solutions in Adobe Analytics.

## System requirements for browser-based solutions

Most Adobe Analytics solutions, including Analysis Workspace, are browser-based. Therefore, the most important requirement to use Adobe Analytics is a modern web browser. Adobe supports the latest stable version of these browsers:

* Microsoft Edge
* Google Chrome 
* Mozilla Firefox 
* Apple Safari

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe ended support for Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 within Adobe Analytics on 13 November 2018. 

## System requirements for non-browser solutions

See the linked solution page for that solution's system requirements.
