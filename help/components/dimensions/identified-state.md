# Identified state

The 'Identified state' dimension is specific to [Cross-Device Analytics](../cda/overview.md) virtual report suites. It reports if hits are identified (stitched) or not by the system at the time the report is run. This dimension is helpful in understanding how well CDA stitches or "compresses" data.

## Populate this dimension with data

As long as you have [Cross-Device Analytics](../cda/overview.md) configured for a virtual report suite, this dimension works out of the box.

## Dimension items

Dimension items include `"Identified"` and `"Unidentified"`.

* **`"Identified"`**: The hit is mapped to a person.
* **`"Unidentified"`**: The hit is not mapped to a person and could not be mapped by any attribution method.
