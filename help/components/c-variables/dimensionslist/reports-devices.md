# Devices

Displays a detailed list of the mobile devices used to access your site.

Non-mobile traffic is listed on this report so you can quickly compare the percentage of traffic from mobile and non-mobile devices.

You can use this dimension to create segments for mobile and non-mobile traffic by including hits where Mobile Device exists (all mobile traffic) or does not exist (all non-mobile traffic).

**Dynamic Device Data**

This report uses dynamic device data that is continually being updated as new devices are released and identified. For example, a new tablet that is released during the current month might be misidentified since it doesn't yet exist in the device database. When the device database is updated with the new device, any changes as a result are applied to all reporting dates. Therefore, you might see slight variations on this report for historical dates over time. As a general rule, the most current report will have the most accurate data for any reporting period.
