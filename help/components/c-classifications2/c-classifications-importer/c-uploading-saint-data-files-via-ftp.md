Steps that describe how to upload data files via FTP.

**[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Classification Importer]**.

The following recommended limits are important:

* Lots of small files will result in slower processing than a few large files. This is due to the amount of queueing and prioritizing required for the smaller jobs.
* Please break large files into 50 MB chunks. This is not required, but is recommended because it gives better visibility into progress on the back end. Also, if errors occur while we are process your job, the job will be restarted; large files result in large amounts of work redone in this scenario.

The initial setup populates the classifications database with a large set of original data, or restructures the classifications, rather than reclassifying a few rows or adding rows.

Following an initial upload in a report suite (for a given variable or report), Adobe recommends uploading only new and updated rows in subsequent imports. Rows that are not being changed should be omitted from future uploads.

Each new key value you upload counts against your uniques for that variable for the month.

If you have exceeded your uniques for the month, you will not see the corresponding classifications data for the uniques exceeded values in reporting. You can see those classifications in either data warehouse or ad hoc analysis.

> [!NOTE] The time required to process a classification data file varies on the size of the file and the current number of files already being processed by Adobe's servers. Processing of data files usually takes no longer than 72 hours.

Before uploading data via FTP, create an FTP account. For more information, see [Create an FTP account](/help/components/c-classifications2/c-classifications-importer/c-uploading-saint-data-files-via-ftp.md#task_C019268E6C934C7C95F4326F42A22CCF).

Steps that describe how to use an FTP account to import classifications into Adobe Analytics.

For more information about creating an FTP account, see [Create an FTP account](/help/components/c-classifications2/c-classifications-importer/c-uploading-saint-data-files-via-ftp.md#task_C019268E6C934C7C95F4326F42A22CCF).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Classification Importer]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Import File]**, then click **[!UICONTROL FTP Import]**.
1. Next to the FTP account that you want to use, click **[!UICONTROL View]**.
1. Use the FTP access information (Host, Login, Password) to access the FTP server using an FTP client of your choosing.
1. Upload the data file ( [!DNL .tab] or [!DNL .txt]) to the FTP server.
1. After uploading the data file, upload a FIN file that indicates the file is ready to process.

   The FIN file is an empty file that has the same name as your data file, with a [!DNL .fin] filename extension. For example, if your data file is [!DNL classdata1.tab], the FIN filename is [!DNL classdata1.fin].

At regular intervals, Adobe retrieves uploaded data files that have an associated FIN file. Adobe imports them into the report suites and data sets specified in the FTP account configuration.
