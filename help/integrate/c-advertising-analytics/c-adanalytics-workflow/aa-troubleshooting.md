You are trying to [set up a new Advertising Account](/help/integrate/c-advertising-analytics/c-adanalytics-workflow/aa-create-ad-account.md) and you do not see your report suite listed in the **[!UICONTROL Select Report Suite]** drop-down list. There are two possible reasons for this:

  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>1. The Report suite is not mapped to the Experience Cloud Org ID of the login user. </p> </td>
