## QUICK EDIT panel

When you select one or more data blocks in a spreadsheet, Report Builder displays the QUICK EDIT panel. You can use the QUICK EDIT panel to change parameters in a single data block or to change parameters in multiple data blocks at the same time.

The changes made using the Quick Edit sections apply to all selected data blocks.

### Report suites

Data blocks pull data from a selected report suite. If multiple data blocks are selected in a worksheet and they don't pull data from the same report suite, the **Report Suites** link displays *Multiple*.

When you change the report suite, all data blocks in the selection adopt the new report suite. Components in the data block are matched to the new report suite based on ID, for example, matching ```evars```). If a component isn't found in a data block, a warning message is displayed and the component is removed from the data block.

To change the report suite, select a new report suite from the drop-down menu.

### Filters

The **Filters** link displays a summary list of the filters used by the selected data blocks. If multiple data blocks are selected with multiple filters applied, the **Filters** link displays *Multiple*.
