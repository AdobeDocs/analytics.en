# Move from page template to page template

If your site has types of pages or page templates, you could use pathing to understand how they move from type to type.

You need to first capture the page type or template in a prop set aside for only that purpose. Then have Adobe [!DNL Customer Care] enable pathing on that prop. You can now view your page template pathing reports to understand how users move from template to template on your site.
