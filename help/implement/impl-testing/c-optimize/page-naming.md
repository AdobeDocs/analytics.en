# Page naming

The pageName variable is used to identify each page that is tracked on the website.

If the *`pageName`* variable is not populated with a defined value (such as Home), [!DNL Analytics] uses the URL of the page. Because the page name is central to your reports, make sure that all parties in your organization agree on a strategy before you implement.

Depending on the content management system your site uses, it is helpful to add content elements to your system that can be used to populate [!DNL Analytics] variables. Many companies find that most [!DNL Analytics] variables can be populated from existing content management elements.
