# Preparing for the Data Connectors Email Integration{#preparing-for-the-data-connectors-email-integration}

Tasks and information you must have before you run the Data Connectors integration wizard to implement the Data Connectors integration.

Adobe Analytics® provides organizations with actionable, real-time intelligence regarding their online strategies and marketing initiatives. Combined with emarsys, Analytics provides remarketing based on behavioral targeting. Improve target marketing and understand campaign effectiveness through seamless integration of emarsys and Analytics web analytics data.

Before you can configure the integration for your email account, you will need to have the following in place:

* Know your emarsys AccountCode because it will be entered in the Data Connectors wizard.
* Know which email address you want to use to receive notification concerning the integrated operations.
* Identify or create the custom variable that you will use to capture the Recipient ID.
* Identify or create the custom variable that you will use to capture the Message ID (often this is the campaign variable).
* Identify or create the custom events that you will use to collect the bounces, clicks, opens, sends, and unsubscribes.
