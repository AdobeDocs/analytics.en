# Checkouts

The 'Checkouts' metric shows the number of times a visitor started the checkout process. This metric is helpful when you want to understand the part of the conversion funnel where customers have a cart of products and are ready to purchase them.

## How this metric is calculated

This metric counts the number of hits where `scCheckout` exists in the [`events`](/help/implement/vars/page-vars/events/events-overview.md) variable.
