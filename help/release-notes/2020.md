# 2020 Adobe Analytics release notes

## November/December 2020 {#nov2020}

| Feature | [General Availability](/help/release-notes/releases.md) - Target Date | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Adobe Analytics documentation | November 11, 2020 | Adobe Analytics documentation has moved to Experience League. During November, all articles, videos, release notes, and tutorials moved from their current location to `experienceleague.adobe.com`. This move ensures that all learning, self-help, enablement, and community content is served from a single location. All links were redirected to Experience League. |
|[!UICONTROL Workspace] [!UICONTROL Line] visualization: Moving average trendline option | October 8, 2020 | Moving average has been added to [!UICONTROL Line] visualization trendline settings. Also known as a rolling average, a moving average uses a specific number of data points (determined by a [!UICONTROL Periods] selection), averages them, and uses the average as a point in the line.

| [!UICONTROL Data Repair] API | October 8, 2020 | The [!UICONTROL Data Repair] API is a tool to delete data from Analytics report suites. The October release includes the ability to delete specified eVars, props, and [!UICONTROL Activity Map] variables for a specified date range. Additional functionality will be released in the future. Use of the [!UICONTROL Data Repair] API permanently deletes existing Adobe Analytics data. We recommend a careful approach to executing the repair to minimize accidental deletion. Access to the [!UICONTROL Data Repair] API requires a contract - reach out to your account team for more details.

* Fixed an issue with the segment UI breaking after pasting values into a container. (AN-233998)
* Fixed an issue with the [!UICONTROL Data Feeds] job history missing some hourly data. (AN-231776)
* Fixed an issue that occurred when copying calculated metrics. It resulted in the error message “You are not authorized to access this metric”. (AN-238070)
* Fixed an issue with being unable to set proper alignment on the [!UICONTROL Text] visualization in [!UICONTROL Workspace]. (AN-238188)

### Important notices for [!DNL Analytics] administrators

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
|Adding HSTS header to all incoming HTTPS requests | Sept. 29, 2020 | On Sept. 29, 2020, we started adding the HSTS header to all incoming requests that use HTTPS. This instructs the browser/client to make all future requests in HTTPS, which is a considered a security best practice. At this point, we will not enforce this for incoming requests using HTTP. |
| Change to Experience Cloud ID Service cookie setting | Sept. 22, 2020 | An update to the privacy settings for Chrome version 80 impacted the ability of Adobe Analytics to track some users viewing Google AMP pages. Specifically, it prevents cross-domain tracking of users viewing Google-hosted AMP pages. This could result in inflated counts of unique visitors. This fix allows users to address this problem by changing the settings for their ECID cookies.<br>Currently, Analytics sets Experience Cloud ID Service (ECID) cookies with the setting `SameSite = Lax` which, prior to version 80 of Chrome, allowed cross-domain tracking. This is no longer the case. This change allows users to update the SameSite setting for ECID cookies to `None`.<br>Note that this allows the Analytics cookie to be shared in more situations, but Analytics cookies do not contain sensitive information. In addition, when choosing this setting, cookies must be set to `Secure` so that data can be passed only via HTTPS connections. If you would like to make this change, please have a supported user open a ticket with Customer Care. |
| Migration from `omniture.com` to `adobe.com` domain | Aug. 21, 2020 | On August 13, 2020, Adobe Analytics migrated its frontend architecture from `omniture.com|http://omniture.com/` to the `adobe.com|http://adobe.com/` domain. This change should mitigate third-party cookie issues that arose after the initial May 28, 2020 unified product domain change. As a result of this update, the browser may prompt users to trust the new an `.adobe.com|http://an.adobe.com/` or `experience.adobe.com|http://experience.adobe.com/` domain. |
| Update on Ad Hoc Analysis Java 8 compatibility | Aug. 21, 2020 | Ad Hoc Analysis is not currently compatible with Java 8 versions 1.8.0_261+. To ensure that your access to this tool is not disrupted before the [end-of-life date](https://spark.adobe.com/page/S9Bhp66VJ2fEn/) is reached, we recommend that you maintain a Java 8 version prior to 1.8.0_261. |
| EOL of Adobe Data Connectors | July 13, 2020 | Adobe [!UICONTROL Data Connectors] are powered by legacy technology that is no longer viable or supported. We have a new standard in the [Adobe Exchange Partner Program](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud) that should be adopted for any integrations that wish to continue to be offered and supported. The official end-of-life date is still to be determined, but we anticipate it to be in the next 12-18 months (mid 2021 to end of 2021). [Learn more...](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/import/dataconnectors/data-connectors-eol.html) |

While Adobe Analytics works to remove all `omniture.com` domain references from its architecture, it is important to allowlist `omniture.com` as a third-party cookie. When the full architecture migration is (soon) completed, we will notify you via the release notes and this allowlist step will no longer be needed. [Here](https://helpx.adobe.com/analytics/kb/adobe-ip-addresses.html) is a full list of recommended IP addresses and domains that you should allowlist.<br>If your organization blocks third-party cookies, please reach out to Customer Care to regain your access to Adobe Analytics. |

Because you can now turn _Nones_ on and off in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace], we apply the _None_ value after the entry or exit, whereas (for eVars) it used to be applied before entry or exit. For example, assume that the first hit of a visit has no value for eVars, but the second hit does. In [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics] the first hit will show as _Unspecified_ for the Entry, but in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace] it will show up as the value on the second hit. |

Current integrations built using these services will stop working. <ul><li>1.3 Analytics APIs</li><li>1.4 SOAP Analytics APIs</li><li>Legacy OAuth Authentication (OAuth and JWT)</li></ul>We have provided a [Legacy API EOL FAQ](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/APIEOL.md?mv=email) to help answer your questions and provide guidance on how to proceed. API integrations that employ these services can migrate to the [1.4 Analytics REST APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis?mv=email) or the [2.0 Analytics APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis?mv=email).

### Important notices for [!DNL Analytics] administrators

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Migration from `omniture.com` to `adobe.com` domain | August 21, 2020 | On August 13, 2020, Adobe Analytics migrated its frontend architecture from `omniture.com|http://omniture.com/` to the `adobe.com|http://adobe.com/` domain. This change should mitigate third-party cookie issues that arose after the initial May 28, 2020 unified product domain change. As a result of this update, the browser may prompt users to trust the new `an.adobe.com|http://an.adobe.com/` or `experience.adobe.com|http://experience.adobe.com/` domain. |
| Update on Ad Hoc Analysis Java 8 compatibility | August 21, 2020 | Ad Hoc Analysis is not currently compatible with Java 8 versions 1.8.0_261+. To ensure that your access to this tool is not disrupted before the [end-of-life date](https://spark.adobe.com/page/S9Bhp66VJ2fEn/) is reached, we recommend that you maintain a Java 8 version prior to 1.8.0_261. |
| EOL of Adobe Data Connectors | July 13, 2020 | Adobe [!UICONTROL Data Connectors] are powered by legacy technology that is no longer viable or supported. We have a new standard in the [Adobe Exchange Partner Program](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud) that should be adopted for any integrations that wish to continue to be offered and supported. The official end-of-life date is still to be determined, but we anticipate it to be in the next 12-18 months (mid 2021 to end of 2021). [Learn more...](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/import/dataconnectors/data-connectors-eol.html) |
| Report suite mapping to organization ID | July 2020 | The report suite mapping tool will be discontinued in November 2020. This feature powers integrations such as Advertising Analytics and Experience Cloud segment publishing in Adobe Analytics. A report suite must be mapped to an organization ID to enable these and other services. Newer report suites are automatically mapped upon creation. However, older report suites must be manually mapped to an organization ID. |
| Migration to unified product domain | Effective date: May 28, 2020|The migration to a unified product domain for Adobe Analytics, which began in January 2020, completed on May 28, 2020. While Adobe Analytics works to remove all `omniture.com` domain references from its architecture, it is important to allowlist `omniture.com` as a third-party cookie. When the full architecture migration is (soon) completed, we will notify you via the release notes and this allowlist step will no longer be needed. [Here](https://helpx.adobe.com/analytics/kb/adobe-ip-addresses.html) is a full list of recommended IP addresses and domains that you should allowlist.<br>If your organization blocks third-party cookies, please reach out to Customer Care to regain your access to Adobe Analytics. |
| New Adobe Analytics default landing page | Effective Date: June 18, 2020 | On June 18, 2020, the default landing page for Adobe Analytics will change from [!UICONTROL Reports] to [!UICONTROL Workspace]. This change will occur for any users who have not previously set a custom landing page. |
| Change to how [!UICONTROL Entries/Exits] are calculated in [!UICONTROL Workspace] | April 7, 2020 | In [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace], as of March 2020, we have changed how the _None_ value interacts with [!UICONTROL Entries/Exits]. Because you can now turn _Nones_ on and off in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace], we apply the _None_ value after the entry or exit, whereas (for eVars) it used to be applied before entry or exit. For example, assume that the first hit of a visit has no value for eVars, but the second hit does. In [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics] the first hit will show as _Unspecified_ for the Entry, but in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace] it will show up as the value on the second hit. |
| EOL of **[!UICONTROL Dashboard Archive]** | March 27, 2020 | The **[!UICONTROL View Archive]** setting under **[!UICONTROL Manage Dashboards]** in [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics] will no longer be available as of October, 2020. |

Current integrations built using these services will stop working. <ul><li>1.3 Analytics APIs</li><li>1.4 SOAP Analytics APIs</li><li>Legacy OAuth Authentication (OAuth and JWT)</li></ul>We have provided a [Legacy API EOL FAQ](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/APIEOL.md?mv=email) to help answer your questions and provide guidance on how to proceed. API integrations that employ these services can migrate to the [1.4 Analytics REST APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis?mv=email) or the [2.0 Analytics APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis?mv=email). Legacy OAuth accounts can migrate to an [Adobe Developer](https://developer.adobe.com/console) account, which can be used to access both the 1.4 Analytics APIs and 2.0 Analytics APIs. |

### Adobe Analytics fixes

* Adobe changed the [!UICONTROL Time Spent] metric to never include "Unspecified" in the calculation. This means that, regardless of whether the UI says to include "Unspecified", we make a special exception to always exclude "Unspecified" in the [!UICONTROL Time Spent] calculation. Therefore, even if you configured a report containing the [!UICONTROL Time Spent] metric to include "Unspecified", it will always return 0 time spent for the "Unspecified" line item. Note that this may change historical reporting in Reports & Analytics as well as the Reporting API v1.4. (AN-197958)
* Fixed an issue in which the Instance/Visit/Visitor wasn't being counted in the denominator for the [!UICONTROL Time Spent] metrics.  This would happen when a hit with no value for the dimension (e.g., [!UICONTROL Pagename]) mfollowed in the same second. (AN-211074)
* Fixed an issue that caused missing [!DNL Analytics] segment data in Audience Manager. (AN-206221)

* Fixed an issue where users with Federated IDs were not able to log in to [!UICONTROL Report Builder]. (AN-207750)
* Fixed an issue with [!UICONTROL AdWords] data not showing in [!UICONTROL Advertising Analytics]. (AN-213249)
* Fixed an issue where classification data did not display in the trended view. (AN-212761)
* Fixed an issue that caused an incorrect published segment count in the [!UICONTROL Segment Manager]. (AN-213374)
* Fixed an issue with the **[!UICONTROL Show Upwards Trend As...]** option in the [!UICONTROL Calculated Metric Editor] – it did not work when applying filters. (AN-214223)
* Fixed multiple issues with [!UICONTROL Classification] Import and Export. (AN-213488, AN-215309, AN-216345, AN-215307, AN-216671)
* Fixed multiple issues with [!UICONTROL Classification Rule Builder]. (AN-213826, AN-213550, AN-213095)
* Fixed issues with [!UICONTROL Data Sources] processing. (AN-218083, AN-213604, AN-214102, AN-215485, AN-215339, AN-212911, AN-217551, AN-217947, AN-219018, AN-214691, AN-218401)
* Fixed FTP connectivity issues. (AN-115525)
* Fixed multiple [!DNL Analytics] [!UICONTROL Data Feeds] issues. (AN-176769, AN-160480, AN-211923, AN-204286, AN-212977, AN-214528, AN-215080, AN-217784, AN-219093, AN-218817, AN-217798, AN-218267, AN-218382)
* Fixed issues with [!UICONTROL Data Warehouse] requests. (AN-181836)
* Fixed issues in PDF downloaded [!UICONTROL Workspace] projects, where values were converted into special characters. (AN-196153)
* Fixed an issue with being unable to copy [!UICONTROL Product Profile] permissions in [!UICONTROL Admin Console]. (AN-211113)
* Fixed an issue where time formats in calculated metrics were broken for negative values. (AN-210900)
* Fixed an issue that prevented users from changing the [!UICONTROL Attribution Model] on static row metrics. (AN-207872)

* Fixed an issue that happened when changing the date range in [!UICONTROL Workspace] and selecting **[!UICONTROL Apply to all panels]**. The date did not change in some panels. (AN-214944)
* Fixed an issue with not being able to create or edit alerts. (AN-215920)
* Fixed an issue with all dynamic date ranges in [!UICONTROL Workspace] showing incorrect dates due to the first day of the week sporadically switching to a Sunday from a Monday. (AN-218835)

### Important notices for [!DNL Analytics] administrators

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| -----------| ---------- | ---------- |
|Migration to unified product domain|Effective date: May 28, 2020|The migration to a unified product domain for Adobe Analytics, which began in January 2020, completed on May 28, 2020. While Adobe Analytics works to remove all `omniture.com` domain references from its architecture, it is important to allow `omniture.com` as a third-party cookie. When the full architecture migration is (soon) completed, we will notify you via the release notes and this allowlist step will no longer be needed. [Here](https://helpx.adobe.com/analytics/kb/adobe-ip-addresses.html) is a full list of recommended IP addresses and domains that you should allow.<br>If your organization blocks third-party cookies, please reach out to Customer Care to regain your access to Adobe Analytics.|
|New Adobe Analytics default landing page|Effective Date: June 18, 2020|On June 18, 2020, the default landing page for Adobe Analytics will change from [!UICONTROL Reports] to [!UICONTROL Workspace]. This change will occur for any users who have not previously set a custom landing page.|
|Change to how [!UICONTROL Entries/Exits] are calculated in [!UICONTROL Workspace]|April 7, 2020|In [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace], as of March 2020, we have changed how the _None_ value interacts with [!UICONTROL Entries/Exits]. Because you can now turn _Nones_ on and off in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace], we apply the _None_ value after the entry or exit, whereas (for eVars) it used to be applied before entry or exit. For example, assume that the first hit of a visit has no value for eVars, but the second hit does. In [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics] the first hit will show as _Unspecified_ for the Entry, but in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace] it will show up as the value on the second hit.|

|New Adobe Analytics domain|Dec. 18, 2019|On January 16, 2020, Adobe Analytics began moving to a new domain - `https://experience.adobe.com/analytics.`<br>**Note:** This change applies to all users accessing Analytics with their Adobe ID or Enterprise ID. <ul><li>The domain change may cause cookie issues when loading Analytics in Safari. Deselecting _Prevent cross-site tracking_ in the [!DNL Safari] Privacy Preferences enables cookies across domains (and all cross-site experiences), and allows Analytics to function on this new Adobe Experience Cloud domain.

|End of Life - Analytics Legacy APIs|January 9, 2020|In November 2020, the following Analytics Legacy API services will reach their end-of-life and will be shutdown. Current integrations built using these services will stop working. <ul><li>1.3 Analytics APIs</li><li>1.4 SOAP Analytics APIs</li><li>Legacy OAuth Authentication (OAuth and JWT)</li></ul>We have provided a [Legacy API EOL FAQ](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/APIEOL.md?mv=email) to help answer your questions and provide guidance on how to proceed.

### [!DNL AppMeasurement]

See [AppMeasurement for JavaScript release notes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/appmeasurement-updates.html). Version 2.19.0 was released on February 21, 2020.

## January 16, 2020 

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- | 
|Analysis Workspace – Freeform Table Builder |With Table Builder enabled, you can drag and drop in many dimensions, breakdowns, metrics and segments to build tables that answer more complex business questions. Data will not update immediately. Instead, updates occur after you select **[!UICONTROL Build]**, saving you time once you know what table you want to construct. Additionally, this feature offers:<ul><li>**Preview**: You can preview the format of a table before spending time to render real data.</li><li>**Flexible Row and breakdown settings**: You can set your row and breakdown levels for every dimension row. Previously, Workspace imposed defaults that could not be changed until after the data was returned.</li><li>**Breakdown by position**: You can set dimension rows to always _breakdown by position_ instead of _by specific item_ (the default).</li><li>**Manual static row ordering**: You can manually order static rows so that the table rows are displayed exactly as you need them. Previously, static rows could be sorted only by a metric column or alphabetically.</li></ul>Associated documentation will be published when this feature releases later in January.|
|New [!UICONTROL Identified State] dimension for Cross-Device Analytics (CDA)|We are adding a new dimension called [!UICONTROL Identified State] to CDA virtual report suites. The dimension has two possible values, _Identified_ and _Unidentified_. _Identified_ means that the person has been identified by the device graph. _Unidentified_ means that the person has not been identified by the device graph.<br>This means that CDA users can now create calculated metrics, such as [!UICONTROL Device Graph Coverage], which describes how many of the people within the virtual report suite are known by the device graph. This metric is helpful for troubleshooting CDA compression rates. If few people are identified, the level of stitching will be low.|
|VRS Support in Data Warehouse API|Virtual Report Suites will now be available for use via the Data Warehouse API. Previously, they were only available via the Data Warehouse UI. When using the Data Warehouse API, you can now see and query virtual report suites, but only if the segments applied to a Virtual Report Suite are compatible with Data Warehouse.|
|Privacy Service API: CCPA|The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) enhances privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California, United States. This Act became effective on January 1, 2020.<br><br/>The CCPA provides new data privacy rights to California residents, such as the right to access and delete their personal data, to know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed (and to whom), and to refuse the sale of their personal data.<br><br/>The Privacy Service supports requests to opt out from the selling of personal data.<br><br/>The Privacy Service was formerly the GDPR Service and retains all the previous functionality, now extended to support CCPA.<br/><br/>[CCPA in Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/data-governance/an-ccpa-overview.html)<br><br/>[Privacy Service Overview](https://www.adobe.com/go/privacy-overview-en)|
