# Manage annotations

The [!UICONTROL Annotations manager] shows you all of the annotations that you own or that have been shared with you. Project-specific annotations do not appear here. You can use this interface to share, filter, tag, copy, delete, and favorite your annotations. Administrators can manage and approve annotations.

| [!UICONTROL Title and Description] | Provided in the Annotations Builder. To edit the title and description, click the title link - this takes you back to the Annotations Builder.  |

## Edit annotations

Editing an annotation means that you can adjust date ranges, colors, scope, or whether it applies to all report suites or projects. You can edit annotations in two ways:

* In a line chart, hover over the annotation and click the pencil icon within the popover.
* In the [!UICONTROL Annotations Manager], click the title of the annotation.

Both of these options land you back in the [!UICONTROL Annotations Builder]. There, you can make the necessary adjustments and save the new version.

## Share annotations

When sharing annotations or working with annotations that were shared with you, keep this in mind:

* If you create a project with project-only annotations then share the project with another user, annotations cannot be edited or deleted by anyone that you share the project with.
* If you save an annotation and share it directly with a user, they can edit/delete the annotation only if they have admin rights.
* If a project is shared with you with a project-only annotation, it shows up only in that project. If the annotation is shared directly with you, it shows up in all projects where that annotation can be displayed. 

## Annotations and time zones

All annotations are created with a timestamp, but no hours or timezone information. At report time, the timezone of the panel's report suite is always applied. For example, an annotation created for Christmas Day happens on December 25 no matter what report suite timezone you are in. 

## Other annotation tasks

The Annotations manager lets Administrators edit, add, tag, delete, rename, approve, copy, export, and filter annotations. It is not visible to non-Admin users. 

Select one or more annotation to see the following options:

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [!UICONTROL Add] | Takes you to the Annotations builder where you can create annotations. |
| [!UICONTROL Tag] | All users can create tags for annotations and apply one or more tags to an annotation. However, you can see tags only for annotations that you own. |
| [!UICONTROL Delete] | Deleting an annotation removes it from any project in your organization. |
| [!UICONTROL Rename] | Renaming an annotation renames it in all projects that it was applied to. |
| [!UICONTROL Copy] | Creates a distinct copy with its own annotation ID, but with the same name and definition.|
| [!UICONTROL Export to CSV] | Export the annotation definition to a .csv file.|
| [!UICONTROL Filter] (left rail) | Filter by tags, report suite, owners, and other filters (Mine, Approved, Favorites, Shared with me, and Show All).|
