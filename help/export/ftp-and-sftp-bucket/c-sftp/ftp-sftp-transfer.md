# Send Adobe data to an external FTP account with SFTP

The Adobe Engineering Services group can set up a custom project to redirect your data to an external FTP account using SFTP.

The value is that your data is sent to you securely without having to retrieve the data from an Adobe FTP site. To determine the scope of the project, contact your Adobe Account Manager.
