# Filter Path Reports by Adding Dependent Requests

Marketing Reports &amp; Analytics offers a few standalone reports that are top path reports with predefined filters, such as [!UICONTROL  Next] and [!UICONTROL  Previous Site Section] reports, Entry and [!UICONTROL  Exit Site Section] reports, and [!UICONTROL  Single Site Section] report. 

Report Builder does not offer these as standalone reports, but you can create them through the ** [!UICONTROL  Add dependent request] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  Path] ** context menus. The following reports are available: 

* Path &amp;gt; Page Fallout
* Path &amp;gt; Entry Path
* Path &amp;gt; Exit Path
* Path &amp;gt; Next Page
* Path &amp;gt; Entry Path &amp;gt; next Page
* Path &amp;gt; Previous Page
* Path &amp;gt; Exit Path &amp;gt; Previous Page
* Path &amp;gt; Entry Path &amp;gt; As Entry Page
* Path &amp;gt; Exit Path &amp;gt; As Exit Page

>1. Select multiple rows from an existing request, then right-click ** [!UICONTROL  Add Dependent Request] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  Path] **.
>   (Note that you have to select at least 3 rows if you want to see the ** [!UICONTROL  Page Fallout] ** menu item.)>

>       ![](Graphics/dependen_request.png)1. Select the predefined filter, for example ** [!UICONTROL  Previous Page] **.
