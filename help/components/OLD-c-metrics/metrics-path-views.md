# Path Views

The Path Views metric is based on pathing data, which is tracked for all users who accept persistent cookies.

The term [!UICONTROL Path View] is used to indicate the number of times a page was viewed, given the constraints of the displayed path(s). This metric reports the number of page views for the given page that occurred within the selected path. This metric is available on the [!UICONTROL Paths] report. [!UICONTROL Path Views] shows you how many times a particular sequence of pages were viewed.

|  Uses  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Traffic  | Not an entire visit length. Usually a collection of paths, each of which is usually 3-4 pages long. Shows the frequency of visits on that particular path.  |
|  Conversion  | N/A  |
|  Ad Hoc Analysis  | Not an entire visit length. Usually a collection of paths, each of which is usually 3-4 pages long. Shows the frequency of visits on that particular path.  |
