# Projects overview

Workspace projects allow you to combine data components, tables and visualizations to craft your analysis and share with anyone in your organization. Before starting your first project, learn about how to access, navigate and manage your projects. 

Here is a video on how to build a Workspace project:

## Project list {#project-list}

When you first go to **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Workspace]**, the page lists all the projects you own or have been shared to you. This page is also the landing page for Adobe Analytics, unless you have previously set a custom landing page. 

The Projects page contains the following information:

## Menu bar {#menu-bar}

Within a project, the menu provides options for managing your project, adding components, finding help, and more. You can also access each menu option by keyboard [shortcuts](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/fa-shortcut-keys).


|  Menu item  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Project  | This menu includes common actions for project management, including New, Open, Save, Save as, and [Save as company report](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/starter-projects.md). You can also refresh the entire project to retrieve the most recent data and definitions by clicking Refresh Project. [Download CSV and PDF](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/curate-share/download-send) options enable you to export data from Workspace. [Project Info & Settings](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview) offers many options for managing your project.  |
|  Edit  | Undo or redo your last action. Clear All resets your project to a blank starting point. |
|  Insert  | Insert new panels or visualizations from this menu. You can also insert new panels and visualizations from the left rail.  |
|  [Components](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/analysis-workspace-components)  | Create new segment, calculated metric, date range, or alert components from your project. You can also create new components from the left rail. If your component definitions have recently changed, Refresh Components retrieves the latest definitions. |
|  [Share](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/curate-share/send-schedule-files)  | Curate, share and schedule PDF/CSV projects to recipients in your organization.  |
|  Help  | Access help documentation, videos, and the Analytics [Experience League community](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/adobe-analytics/ct-p/adobe-analytics-community). Manage the visibility of Workspace tips as well as the [debugger](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/2.0/). Find details about Workspace and factors that impact project [performance](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/workspace-faq/optimizing-performance).  |
|  Share button or Owner  | If you are in an Own or Edit for the project, the Share button in the top-right gives you one-click access to manage your project recipients. If you are in a Duplicate or View role for the project, you see the project owner's name. |

### Project Info & Settings {#info-settings}

**[!UICONTROL Workspace]** > **[!UICONTROL Project]** > **[!UICONTROL Project Info & settings]** provides project-level information on the currently active project.

![Project Info](assets/projectinfo.png)

Settings include:

|  Setting  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Project Name  | The name given to the project. You can double-click the name to edit it.  |
|  Owner  | Project owner name  |
|  Last Modified  | Date of last modification to the project.  |
|  Tags  |Lists any tags applied to a project for easier categorization.  |
|  Description  | A description is useful for clarifying the purpose of a project. You can double-click the description to edit it.  |
|  Count repeat instances  | Specifies whether repeat instances are counted in reports. For example, this setting (when activated) treats multiple consecutive pages views to the same page as multiple page views. With it off, they count as a single page view (this setting only affects certain metrics, such as Single Page Visits). **Note**: This setting does not apply to Flow or Fallout visualizations.  |
| [Show annotations](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/annotations/overview.md) | Specify whether to show annotations in the project or not. |
|  [Project color palette](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/color-palettes)  | You can change the categorical color palette used in Workspace, by choosing from out-of-the-box palettes that have been optimized for color blindness, or by specifying your custom palette. This feature affects many things in Workspace, including most visualizations.  |
| [View Density](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/view-density) | Lets you see more data on the screen by reducing the vertical padding of the left rail, freeform tables and cohort tables. |

## Left rail {#left-rail}

Within a project, various icons are available in the left rail, and each represents important tools to build your project:

| Icon | Functionality |
|---|---|
| ![panels icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_WebPage_18_N.svg) | [Panels](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/c-panels/panels.md) |
| ![visualizations icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_GraphBarVertical_18_N.svg) |[Visualizations](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-analysis-visualizations.md) |
| ![components icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Curate_18_N.svg) | [Components](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/analysis-workspace-components.md) |
| ![data dictionary icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Bookmark_18_N.svg) | [Data dictionary](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/data-dictionary/data-dictionary-overview.md) |
| ![toc icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_ViewList_18_N.svg) | [Table of contents](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/project-table-of-contents.md) |

Components (dimensions, metrics, segments, date ranges) in the left rail relate to the active panel data view. A blue border identifies the active panel, and the active report suite is listed at the top of the component rail.


## Right-click menu

Here is a video on using the right-click menu in Analysis Workspace:

## Project canvas {#canvas}

The project canvas is where you bring together panels, tables, visualizations, and components to build your analysis. A project can contain many panels, and each panel can contain many tables and visualizations.

Panels are helpful when you want to organize your projects according to time periods, report suites, or analysis use case. The active panel has a colored border around it, and determines what components are available in the left rail.

Depending on the starting point you chose for your projects, you either have a [freeform table](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/freeform-table) or a [blank panel](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/panels/blank-panel) in the canvas to begin with. The quickest way to start analyzing is to select one or many components and simply drag & drop them into the project canvas. A table of data is rendered automatically for you. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/freeform-table) about the different options for building a table, or leverage the available [training tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home) for more guidance on building your first project.
