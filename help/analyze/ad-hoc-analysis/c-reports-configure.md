## Chart Options {#concept_9934CD0383AB4AA1A7B04C9F8AD30E6F}

Options you can configure on a chart, such as changing the graph type, colors, and number of lines. Chart options differ depending on the type of graph you select.

## Bubble Chart {#concept_07E26CC767B247A5845ADFF0C18B0986}

<!-- 

c_reports_bubble.xml

 -->

Bubble charts offer metrics analysis for up to five separate dimensions. The bubble chart dynamically changes to reflect changes in the report data. The bubble chart is available for any ranked report.

|  Element  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  [!UICONTROL Dimensions]  | Specifies the reporting dimension.  |
|  [!UICONTROL Data Points]  | Specifies the number of data points to display in the bubble chart.  |
|  [!UICONTROL Show Linear Regression]  | Displays a statistical approximation of your data.  |

## Break Down Table Data {#task_29BEE0AF09DA4625B9B44BAB77D7C841}

<!-- 

t_reports_breakdown_table.xml

 -->

Certain reports let you break down the table data so that you can see subrelated data in the report. You can break down any dimension by any other dimension item, report, segment, and so on.

**To break down table data** 

1. Run a report.
1. Right-click a line item, then click **[!UICONTROL Breakdown]** > *item.*

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >For more flexibility, use the [Table Builder](/help/analyze/ad-hoc-analysis/c-tablebuilder.md) to configure a report with breakdowns. After you open a saved or scheduled report with breakdowns, you might need to click **[!UICONTROL Replace Table]** to refresh a breakdown of dynamic report data. For example, you might need to refresh a scheduled report containing breakdowns of line items that can change based on the date range or visitor activity.

## Change the Report Type in the Table {#task_B48F97F0F6D5448A969D55238E93F2FB}

<!-- 

t_reports_changing_types.xml

 -->

For ranked reports, you can change the report to a different type of report while preserving the segments, metrics, and comparisons that you set up in the original report. This change expedites the process of gathering data, because there is no need to segment and configure successive reports

**To change the report type in the table** 

1. Open and configure a ranked report.
1. Right-click the report name column heading in the table, then click **[!UICONTROL Select Report]**, then navigate to the report.

## Copy Data to the Clipboard {#task_357E53EF61FF49F8BE5AC8D2F419375C}

<!-- 

t_reports_clipboard.xml

 -->

1. Open Microsoft Excel.

   It is recommended that you open Excel prior to copying data, because Excel clears the memory buffer when it starts.

1. At the report level, click **[!UICONTROL Settings]** ![](assets/settings_icon.png), then click **[!UICONTROL Copy Report Data]**.
1. In Excel, select a cell, then paste the data.

## Extract Visitor IDs {#task_7223BE8E0389460282825E61BEDC0574}

<!-- 

t_reports_extract_ID.xml

 -->

In Reports &amp; Analytics, you can set a field to contain user ID data. If you configured this option, the [!UICONTROL Extract Visitor IDs] option becomes available. If you do not enable this option, but you decide to enable it later, you cannot go back and extract historical visitor IDs.

**To extract visitor IDs** 

1. Add a Data Warehouse segment to the report.
1. Right-click the segment and select **[!UICONTROL Extract Visitor IDs]**.

   The Data Warehouse application launches.
1. On the [!UICONTROL Data Warehouse Request] tab, type the filter name.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Request this Report]**.

## Trend a Row {#task_83C003EDCA7140C3AE9804629DD7A235}

<!-- 

t_reports_trending_row.xml

 -->

When viewing a ranked report, such as a products report, you can see the trend data for a value. For example, you can see that a product made $10,000 in gross revenue for the selected time period. If you want to see how much revenue that product generated for each day of the time period, you can show a trend graph for the product, or open a separate trended report.

**To trend a row** 

1. Run a ranked report.
1. Click the [!UICONTROL Trend] icon.  ![](assets/TrendInspector_Buttcon.png)

   You can select multiple cells to apply to a single trend report.

1. To launch a report, click **[!UICONTROL Launch Trend Report]**.

## Set Column Width {#task_0FCF395B4A8C40508B38B44586FB5969}

<!-- 

t_column_width.xml

 -->

1. In the table, right-click the column header, then click **[!UICONTROL Column Width]**.

   This option is disabled if [!UICONTROL Fit to Screen] is enabled. 1. Specify a width in pixels, then click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.

## Custom Reports {#concept_039A45AAEEDC4828B3CDA080717B8E4F}

Administrators can configure a report with specific metrics and a specific date range, and then save it to the report menus for everyone to use.

<!-- 

c_reports_custom.xml

 -->

Custom reports can bring increased value to you as an analyst, because they have been deemed worthy of being in everyone's marketing reports and analytics menu. If you see reports in your interface that don't match someone else's (such as in Training), your admin may have set up some of these custom reports.

Additionally, you can save reports that are important to you. These reports are called bookmarks. You can also put several reports onto one canvas to get a quick look at your most important reports. These are called dashboards and are also user-specific. The interface displays a bar above the graph listing your bookmarks and dashboards.
