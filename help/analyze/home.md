# Analytics Tools Guide

![Banner](../../assets/doc_banner_analyze.png)

This guide provides product documentation and self-help for the following Adobe Analytics reporting and analysis tools:

* **[!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace]:** The foremost feature in Adobe Analytics. Workspace provides a canvas where you can drag components to meet reporting needs.
* **[!UICONTROL Activity Map]:** A browser plug-in that displays an overlay on your site showing which elements were clicked the most.
* **[!UICONTROL Ad Hoc Analysis]:** A standalone Java application with robust reporting capabilities. This tool is no longer updated, and will eventually be sunset in the future.
* **[!UICONTROL Reporting API]:** Make report queries directly to Adobe's servers, and get responses for use in your own customer reporting tools.
* **[!UICONTROL Report Builder]:** An Excel add-in that allows you to retrieve Analytics data and place it directly into a workbook.
* **[!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics]:** A tool with dozens of pre-built reports. Adobe recommends using Analysis Workspace for most reporting needs.
