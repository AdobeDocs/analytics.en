# Classification set jobs manager

The Classification set jobs manager lets you see current and completed classification jobs that were generated from classification sets. You can also use this interface to download classification data or templates for a particular job, or upload additional data to a job.

**[!UICONTROL Components]** > **[!UICONTROL Classification sets]** > **[!UICONTROL Jobs]**

You cannot create jobs from this interface. Create jobs by uploading data to a classification set (either manually or through a configured external location), requesting a download file, or requesting a template file.

## Filter classification sets

The left side of the Classification set job manager provides filter settings to locate the desired job. Clicking the filter icon toggles the filter settings visibility. You can filter Classification sets by **[!UICONTROL Classification set]**, **[!UICONTROL Completion time]**, **[!UICONTROL Status]**, **[!UICONTROL Job Type]**, or **[!UICONTROL Source]**.
