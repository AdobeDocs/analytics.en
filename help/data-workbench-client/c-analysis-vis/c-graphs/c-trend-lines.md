# Trend lines

Trend lines lets you overlay graphs to compare and interpret data.

Like the [Scatter Plot](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/insight/client/?f=c_scat_plots) visualization, you can now set trend lines on a bar graph visualization to display the rate of change based on linear, exponential, power, or polynomial lines. The Trend Line feature allows you to overlay trend lines on a graph, most commonly over a Time dimension.

For example, in this graph comparison, we can see that Visits are trending up, but Orders are trending down.

**To add a Trend Line**

1. Open a graph and right-click the metric name in the upper left corner. 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Trend Lines]** and select from the options.

   You can select the trend line to appear over the graph as **Simple Linear**, **Exponential**, **Power**, or **Polynomial**. Polynomial will create a polynomial regression trend line. Simple Linear will create a trend line as the rate of change along the regression line. Exponential calculates a trend line as y = b&#42;exp( a&#42;x ) and Power as y = b&#42;x.

   The trend will be calculated and rendered on the graph, and a callout will open displaying detailed information of the trend equation.
