# Ad Hoc Analysis overview{#ad-hoc-analysis-overview}

Ad Hoc Analysis helps you identify high-value customer segments with unlimited real-time visitor information, allowing you to drill down into the data to get deep, precise, and comprehensive views of your customers.

>[!Important]
>Changes were made to the Ad Hoc Analysis JNLP file that require you to download a new version of this file with the April 12, 2018 Maintenance Release. Failure to do so will result in a Java error when starting Ad Hoc Analysis, and will prevent you from launching the application.

>[!Important]
>As of July 2018, Ad Hoc Analysis will support only Java 8 or higher. Due to security fixes not supported in older versions of Java, we will reject connections from Java 7 and will no longer provide access to versions that run on Java 7.
