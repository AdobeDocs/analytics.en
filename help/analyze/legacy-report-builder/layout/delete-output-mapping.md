# Delete output mapping

If you are editing your workbook and want to make room for new requests, you might need to delete requests.

The only way to make room is to delete requests mapped to cells. If you delete requests in the spreadsheet by removing rows or columns, the underlying request validity is lost (and would fail on refresh). The Excel menu selection **[!UICONTROL Edit]** > **[!UICONTROL Clear Contents]** removes the value displayed in the cell. The contents can be restored by refreshing the contents of the cell.

To remove a specific mapping of spreadsheet cells, locate the row, column, or metric item and click **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.
