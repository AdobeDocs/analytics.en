# Year

The 'Year' dimension reports the year that a given metric occurred. The first dimension value is the first year in the date range, and the last dimension value is the most recent year in the date range.

## Populate this dimension with data

This dimension works out of the box for all implementations. If a report suite contains data, this dimension works.

## Dimension values

Dimension values include a given year, with the dates included in parentheses.
