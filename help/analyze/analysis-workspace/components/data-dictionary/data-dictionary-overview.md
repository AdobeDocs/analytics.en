# Data Dictionary overview

The Data Dictionary in Analysis Workspace helps both users and administrators keep track of and better understand the components in their Analytics environment.   

System administrators are responsible for curating this information about each component in the Data Dictionary and making it available to users.

## Benefits and uses of the Data Dictionary

* [Benefits for users](#benefits-for-users)

* [Benefits for administrators](#benefits-for-administrators)

### Benefits for users

 The Data Dictionary helps users gain a better understanding of each component that is available to them. 

Some benefits for users of the Data Dictionary include: 

* The component's function and intended use

* Related components that the component is typically used with

* Components that are similar to the one you are viewing

* Whether the component is approved by the system administrator 

### Benefits for administrators

The Data Dictionary helps system administrators keep track of and curate the components in their Analytics environment. 

Some benefits for administrators of the Data Dictionary include: 

* Identifies duplicate components that need to be consolidated.

* Identifies components that aren't collecting any data so they can be either updated or deleted.

* Shows components that are not yet approved.

* Allows you to update component descriptions directly in Analysis Workspace, and any updates you make are reflected in the Report Suite.

  Similarly, any updates you make to component descriptions in the Report Suite are reflected in Analysis Workspace.

  For more information about adding component descriptions in either Analysis Workspace or in a Report Suite, see [Add component descriptions](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/add-component-descriptions.md).
