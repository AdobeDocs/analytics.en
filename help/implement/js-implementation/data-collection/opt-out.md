Adobe recommends that you provide your website visitors with easy-to-find and easy-to-understand information regarding the ability to opt out of having their browsing information collected by Adobe products or services.

Visitors can learn more about how Adobe generally uses information it collects in connection with providing our products and services to our customers in the [Adobe Privacy Center](http://www.adobe.com/privacy.html). However, because you exclusively control how to implement our services on your web sites, it is up to you to describe to your website visitors the specific ways in which they use our products and services. You are responsible for the creation of your own privacy policy, for complying with your privacy policy, for complying with your service agreement with Adobe, and for complying with all applicable laws.

## Opt-outs for Adobe Analytics (including Reports & Analytics, Data Warehouse, Ad Hoc Analysis) {#section_8089B80CDA4043C9BC2DED49E484E8D7}

Adobe offers three types of opt-outs for Adobe Analytics (including Reports & Analytics, Data Warehouse, Ad Hoc Analysis):

* If you implement Adobe Analytics products with your own first-party cookie, you need to [develop your own customized opt-out link](../../js-implementation/data-collection/opt-out-link.md#concept_C2C4F19811A445EF9E9BEAC709B568A9) for your website visitors. 
* Adobe also provides an opt-out mechanism to the public for websites using cookies set from Adobeâ€™s 2o7.net and omtrdc.net domains. This opt-out mechanism can be accessed from the [Adobe Privacy Center](http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html). 
* Your customers have the option of enabling opt-out using the browser's cookie settings. See [Enable privacy settings for browser cookies](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/whitepapers/cookies/?f=browser_cookie_settings).

Regardless of the opt-out mechanism you choose, Adobe recommends that you clearly describe the availability of the opt-out mechanism in your privacy policy or as otherwise required by law or recommended according to current best practices.
