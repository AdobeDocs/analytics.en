# Metric calculations

Metrics are calculated using standard, participation, recent, and linear allocation methods. Each method calculates values differently based on formulas.

   <td colname="col1"> Linear </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>When linear allocation is selected, success events are evenly divided across all variable values seen in the visit. For numeric and currency events such as <span class="term"> Revenue</span>, the monetary amount is divided. For counter events such as <span class="term"> Orders</span>, a fraction of the event is awarded to each variable value in the visit. These fractions in reporting are summed, then rounded to the nearest integer in reporting. </p> <p>For example, in a visit where four pages are visited prior to a success event, each page would receive credit for 25% of the event. If, in the same visit, <span class="varname"> campaign</span> had two values, each campaign value would receive 50% of the credit for the event. </p> </td>

## Example - Metric Calculation {#section_4CE01DA35108418D9909823A7ECC4B45}

Assume your site has an internal search that is tracked using a conversion variable (eVar). The visitor performs several internal searches before making a $100 purchase:

*`Pet`* > *`Feline`* > *`Cat`* > *`Kitten`* > $100 purchase

In reporting, credit allocation is as follows: 

<table id="table_91A7244E77854838A8392B49366FB445">

  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> eVar Value </th>
