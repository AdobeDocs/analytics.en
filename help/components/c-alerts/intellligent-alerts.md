# Intelligent alerts

The new Intelligent Alerts system allows for more granular control over alerts and integrates anomaly detection with the alert system.

## Overview {#section_6AC8CA81DEA94E99B0F192B60D0FDF03}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Intelligent Alerts are available to Adobe [!DNL Analytics] Prime and Adobe [!DNL Analytics] Ultimate customers only.

The new Alert Builder and Alert Manager replace the existing alert functionality in Adobe [!DNL Analytics]. Intelligent Alerts let you

* Build alerts based on anomalies (90%, 95%, 99%, 99.75%, and 99.9% thresholds; % change; above/below).
* Preview how often an alert will trigger.
* Send alerts by e-mail or SMS with links to auto-generated Analysis Workspace projects.
* Create "stacked" alerts that capture multiple metrics in a single alert.

Components of the new alert system include: Alert Builder, Alert Manager, Alert Preview, and better in-context access to creating alerts. The old alert system user interface will no longer be available, but the alerts will be migrated. Some legacy alert features [will no longer be available](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/user/deprecated_alerts.html).

There are four ways get to the Alert Builder:

* By using the following shortcut in Analysis Workspace:

  `ctrl (or cmd) + shift + a` 
* By going directly to the Alert Builder:  **[!UICONTROL Workspace]** > **[!UICONTROL Components]** > **[!UICONTROL New Alert]** .
* By selecting one or more freeform table line item/s, right-clicking and selecting **[!UICONTROL Create Alert from Selection]**. This will open the Alert Builder and will pre-populate the builder with the appropriate metrics and filters applied from the table. You can then edit the alert, if needed.

* From within a [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics] report, by going to  **[!UICONTROL More]** > **[!UICONTROL Add Alert]** . This will open the new Alert Builder and will pre-populate the builder with the appropriate metrics and filters applied from the report. You can then edit the alert, if needed.

## FAQ: How Alerts are Calculated and Triggered {#section_1F3B1DAF21784306953B49AAD4C3DCAB}

The % thresholds are standard deviations. For example, 95% = 2 standard deviations and 99% = 3 standard deviations. Depending on the time granularity you choose, [different models](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/virtual-analyst/c-anomaly-detection/statistics-anomaly-detection.md) are used to calculate how far away (how many standard deviations) each data point is from the norm. If you set a lower threshold (such as 90%), you will get more anomalies than if you set a higher threshold (99%). 99.75% & 99.99% thresholds were introduced specifically for the hourly granularity so that it wouldn't trigger as many anomalies.

It uses a fixed 30-day training period, fixed 95% interval, and is similar to <a href="https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/anomaly.html"  > <span class="uicontrol">Reports & Analytics</span> anomaly detection </a>. </p> </td>
