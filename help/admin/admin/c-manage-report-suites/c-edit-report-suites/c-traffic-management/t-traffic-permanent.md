# Specify permanent traffic increase

You can change expected traffic levels so Adobe can reassign resources to handle the new traffic level. (Alternatively, you can [schedule a traffic spike](/help/admin/admin/c-manage-report-suites/c-edit-report-suites/c-traffic-management/t-traffic-schedule-spike.md) if you want to temporarily reassign resources.)
