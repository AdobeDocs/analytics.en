# Build a report for a Data Warehouse request

{{release-limited-testing}}

There are various configuration options available when creating a Data Warehouse request. The following information describes how to build a report for the request.

For information about how to begin creating a request, as well as links to other important configuration options, see [Create a Data Warehouse request](/help/export/data-warehouse/create-request/t-dw-create-request.md). 

To build a report for a Data Warehouse request:

1. Begin creating a request in Adobe Analytics by selecting **[!UICONTROL Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Data Warehouse]** > [!UICONTROL **Add**].

   For additional details, see [Create a Data Warehouse request](/help/export/data-warehouse/create-request/t-dw-create-request.md).

   <td colname="col2"> <p>Lets you select the part of the visitor population you want to examine and generate complex segments. You can load pre-configured segments, create new segments, and store segment components in a library to use in building additional segments. </p> <p>You can now stack segments. When selecting multiple segments, the preview area, the Request Manager, and the Request Detail popup show a comma-separated list of names (e.g., Segment1, Segment2). </p> <p>See the <a href="/help/components/segmentation/seg-home.md"> Segmentation Guide</a> for more information. </p> <p>Note:  You cannot include both a segment filter and a breakdown on the same segment, in the same Data Warehouse report. Doing so will result in an error. </p> </td>

  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <span class="wintitle"> Breakdowns</span> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Lets you categorize data using breakdowns. Segments and breakdowns differ in that a segment filters data out of a data set, while a breakdown compartmentalizes data across all valid values for the breakdown. </p> You can also break down a report by one or more segments. However, you cannot include both a segment filter and a breakdown on the same segment, in the same Data Warehouse report. Doing so will result in an error. <p> For example, use segments to remove a gender from the data set, and use a breakdown to see data separated by gender. </p> <p>When a Data Warehouse request is submitted with multiple multi-value dimensions (e.g., various Mobile Reports), an exponential number of rows can be generated from a single hit. The number of rows that can be output from a single hit is capped at 100 (previously 1,000). </p> </td>

This value represents the date values requested in the report. For example, if you request data from May 1, 2013 through May 7, 2013, the <span class="filepath"> %R</span> shows a filename including the date range of 20130501 - 20130507. </p> </td>
