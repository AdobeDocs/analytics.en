# Fallout

Shows where visitors leave (fallout) and continue through (fallthrough) a pre-specified sequence of pages. It displays conversion and fallout rates between each step. For example, you can track a visitor's fallout points during a buying process. You select a beginning point and a conclusion point, and add intermediate points to create a website navigation path.

This report is useful to analyze:

* Conversion rates through specific processes on your site (such as a purchase or registration process). 
* General, wider-scope traffic flows: Of the people who saw the home page, this flow shows how many went on to perform a search, and then how many of them eventually went on to look at a specific item. 
* Correlations between events on your site. Correlations show what percentage of people who looked at your privacy policy went on to purchase a product.
