# Copy segments

When creating a new segment, it's sometimes easier to copy an existing segment that is close to the segment that you want to create, then modify the version you copied.

To copy a segment in the Segment Manager:

1. In Adobe Analytics, select the **[!UICONTROL Components]** tab, then select **[!UICONTROL Segments]**. 

1. In the Segment Manager, select the segment that you want to copy. 

   The segment management tool bar appears.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Copy]**.
