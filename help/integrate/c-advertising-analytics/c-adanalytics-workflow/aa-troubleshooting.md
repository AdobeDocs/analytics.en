## I don't see my Report Suite in the Mapping section {#section_9CAACDE6445C492DBAE542BA74DE6316}

You are trying to [set up a new Advertising Account](/help/integrate/c-advertising-analytics/c-adanalytics-workflow/aa-create-ad-account.md) and you do not see your report suite listed in the **[!UICONTROL Select Report Suite]** drop-down list. There are two possible reasons for this: 

<table id="table_271D7E817B4C44818717A47C3223E592"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Reason </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> Solution </th> 
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>1. The Report suite is not mapped to the Experience Cloud Org ID of the login user. </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Contact Customer Care to map the report suite to an IMS org.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>2. The Report Suite is not provisioned for Advertising Analytics reporting. </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Refer to <a href="/help/integrate/c-advertising-analytics/c-adanalytics-workflow/aa-provision-rs.md"  > Provision Report Suite</a> for instructions. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>
