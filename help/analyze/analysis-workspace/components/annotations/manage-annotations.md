# Manage annotations

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is currently in limited testing.

The [!UICONTROL Components] > [!UICONTROL Annotations] manager offers many ways of managing annotations, such as sharing, filtering, tagging, approving, copying, deleting, and marking as favorites.

The [!UICONTROL Annotations] manager shows you all the annotations you own that have been scoped to all your projects, and that have been shared with you. 

>[!NOTE]

>[!UICONTROL Annotations] that you created only for a specific project do not appear in the manager.

## Edit annotations

Editing an annotation means that you can adjust date ranges, colors, scope, or whether or not it applies to all report suites or projects. You can edit annotations in two ways:

* In a line chart, hover over the annotation and click the pencil icon within the popover.

* In the [!UICONTROL Annotations Manager], click the title of the annotation.

Both of these options land you back in the Annotations Builder. There, you can make the necessary adjustments and save the new version.
