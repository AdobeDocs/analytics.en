# Saved filters

You can save filters or other parameters in report builder and use them in other worksheets or workbooks. These parameters are saved to Analytics, to ensure that they are available to other report builder users on other computers.

You save filters on the [!UICONTROL Choose Page] form as you create a filter. For an example of this procedure, see [Specific Filters](/help/analyze/report-builder/layout/c-filter-dimensions/t-specific-filters.md).
