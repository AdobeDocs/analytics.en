## Site Content Reports {#concept_6FD804C43698437A88E1E8A19821851E}
>Displays information about which pages and areas of your site are most active and which servers are getting the most use.**Pages**: Ranks the pages on your site based on the pages that receive the most traffic. If your business question deals with quantitative data for pages, you can use this report to answer that question, by adding the right metrics. 

**Site Sections**: Shows the areas of your site that are accessed most by your visitors. Site Sections can include groups of products, similar to categories, which you define. For example, you might have a Cameras group of pages, a Computers group, and so on. Data for the [!UICONTROL  Conversion Site Sections] report is imported from the [!UICONTROL  Site Section] report in the [!UICONTROL  Traffic] group, which receives its information from the channel variable in the marketing reports and analytics tracking code. You can use this report to identify the greatest impact on site statistics from items in varying site sections. 

**Hierarchy**: Shows you the hierarchical layout of the pages on your website and displays those pages in order based on how they are configured in the *` hierN`* variable. This report is populated using proper variable configuration that you set for each page that you want to take part in the hierarchy. This report lets you see selected metrics (such as Unique Visitors) for the hierarchy. 

**Servers**: Lets you group pages that are hosted by a particular server. This report lists all of the servers of your website that marketing reports analytics tracks, and tells you which servers are being accessed the most. For example, if you have a website that is hosted on two different servers, you might want to see if one server is serving more impressions than the other server. 

**Links**: Shows you the links that visitors click when on your website, including links clicked to leave your site, or download links. 


* ** Exit Links**: Displays links that the user clicked to leave your website. These links include links to partner or affiliate websites. 

* ** File Downloads**: Displays the files that have been downloaded from your website. These files can be any type of file you want to track, including user manuals, presentations, audio, or video files. This report requires that link tracking code is installed on the site that you are tracking. See the *Analytics Implementation Guide* for more information. 

* **[!UICONTROL  Custom Links]**: Shows you the links your site visitors prefer, helping you understand the navigation patterns within your site. For example, the Home page for your site likely has multiple links that access the same page. Perhaps there is graphic and text link that both link to the same page. This report shows what percentage of visitors use the graphic link versus the text link. Custom links are specific to your website. The specific links that you want to track must be modified with special tags. For assistance, contact [!DNL  ClientCare].
