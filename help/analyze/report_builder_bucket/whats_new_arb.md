**Edit Metrics across Multiple Requests** 

The Edit Multiple Metrics feature lets you easily add, remove, or replace metrics in a pre-existing group of requests. 

For more information, see [ Edit Metrics Across Multiple Requests](../report_builder_bucket/manage_requests/t_edit_multiple_requests/edit_multiple_metrics.md#concept_1524B059C72C4224AA199411151069AB). 
**Publishing to Power BI with Report Builder 5.5** 

Microsoft Power BI is a suite of business analytics dashboards to analyze data and share insights. The Adobe Analytics integration with Power BI lets you visualize Report Builder Analytics data within Microsoft Power BI and easily share it across your organization. 

Previously you, as an Analyst, would schedule Report Builder workbooks to be disseminated via email (or ftp). You can now give your business user stakeholders access (from within their Power BI accounts) to accurate and up-to-date data in a web-based environment that is accessible across platforms and devices. 

Combining the report-generation capability of Report Builder with the visualization features of Power BI makes information more accessible to everyone in your organization. With Power BI, you can also integrate Adobe Analytics with other data sources (e.g. point of sale, CRM) to discover unique customer insights, associations, and opportunities.

* **New link to the Adobe Report Builder Community** The new Adobe Community link under Help takes you to the Adobe Community Forum with the search narrowed to Report Builder issues. The Adobe Community is a great way to ask your Report Builder peers questions about the application and to find out about or share best practices.

* **Enhanced search for reports and metrics** With more [ eVars and events](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/implement/evars_events.html) being added to Adobe Analytics, the number of reports and metrics offered in Adobe Report Builder is increasing significantly.
