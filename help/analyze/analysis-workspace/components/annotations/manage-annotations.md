# Manage annotations

>[!NOTE]

>This feature is currently in limited testing.

The [!UICONTROL Components] > [!UICONTROL Annotations] manager offers many ways of managing annotations, such as sharing, filtering, tagging, approving, copying, deleting, and marking as favorites.

The [!UICONTROL Annotations] manager shows you all the annotations you own that have been scoped to all your projects, and that have been shared with you. 

>[!NOTE]

>[!UICONTROL Annotations] that you created for a specific project only do not appear in the manager.
