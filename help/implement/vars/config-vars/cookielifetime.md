## Cookie Lifetime using the Web SDK

The Web SDK does not yet offer customization to the lifetime of cookies that it sets.

## Cookie Lifetime using the Adobe Analytics extension

Cookie Lifetime is a drop-down list under the [!UICONTROL Cookies] accordion when configuring the Adobe Analytics extension.

1. Log in to [Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](https://experience.adobe.com/data-collection) using your AdobeID credentials.
1. Click the desired tag property.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click the **[!UICONTROL Configure]** button under Adobe Analytics.
1. Expand the [!UICONTROL Cookies] accordion, which reveals the [!UICONTROL Cookie Lifetime] drop-down list.

This drop-down list contains the following values:

* **Default**: Cookie expires after 2 years.
* **None**: AppMeasurement does not set cookies.
* **Session**: Cookie expires at the end of the visitor's session.
* **Seconds**: Cookie expires after the specified number of seconds have elapsed. For example, setting this drop-down list to [!UICONTROL Seconds] and placing `86400` into the custom field forces cookies to expire after exactly 24 hours.

## s.cookieLifetime in AppMeasurement and the Analytics extension custom code editor

The `s.cookieLifetime` variable is a string that determines the expiration date of cookies set by AppMeasurement.

* If set to `SESSION`, cookies set by AppMeasurement expire after the browser session completes.
* If set to `NONE`, AppMeasurement does not attempt to set cookies.
* If set to an integer string, cookies set by AppMeasurement expire after the specified number of seconds have elapsed.

```js
// Expire cookies after each session
s.cookieLifetime = "SESSION";

// Expire cookies after exactly 24 hours
s.cookieLifetime = "86400";
```
