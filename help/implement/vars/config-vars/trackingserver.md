# trackingServer

Adobe collects data on your site by receiving an image request generated by the visitor. The `trackingServer` variable determines the location an image request is sent. If this variable is not defined correctly, your implementation can experience data loss.

> [!IMPORTANT] Changing this value makes AppMeasurement look for cookies in a different location. Unique visitor count can temporarily spike in reporting as visitor cookies are set in the new location.

## Tracking Server in Adobe Experience Platform Launch

Tracking Server is a field under the [!UICONTROL General] accordion when configuring the Adobe Analytics extension.

1. Log in to [launch.adobe.com](https://launch.adobe.com) using your AdobeID credentials.
2. Click the desired property.
3. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click the [!UICONTROL Configure] button under Adobe Analytics.
4. Expand the [!UICONTROL General] accordion, which reveals the [!UICONTROL Tracking Server] field.

If this field is left blank, it defaults to `[rsid].112.2o7.net`.

## s.trackingServer in AppMeasurement and Launch custom code editor

The `s.trackingServer` variable is a string that contains the location to send data.

> [!TIP] Some implementations point data to `2o7.net`. While this is a valid data collection domain, it does not use regional data collection. Implementations using `2o7.net` see slightly higher image request response times.

## Determine the value for trackingServer

The value for this variable depends on if you use first-party cookies or third-party cookies. Adobe strongly recommends using first-party cookies in your implementation.

### First-party cookies

If you use a first-party cookie implementation, it is likely that someone in your organization has already completed the first-party cookie process. See [First-party cookies in the Experience Cloud](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/core-services/interface/ec-cookies/cookies-first-party.html) in the Core Services user guide for more information on the first-party cookie process.

The individual who initially configures the first-party cookie implementation also defines the domain and subdomain used. For example:

```js
s.trackingServer = "data.example.com";
```

Typically CNAME records are already set up and point to `sc.omtrdc.net`. The domain `2o7.net` is also a valid CNAME destination, primarily used in previous versions of Adobe Analytics.

### Third-party cookies

> [!TIP] Increasing privacy practices in modern browsers make third-party cookies less reliable. Adobe recommends following the first-party cookie workflow.

If you use a third-party cookie implementation, the value for `trackingServer` is a subdomain of `sc.omtrdc.net`. For example:

```js
s.trackingServer = "example.sc.omtrdc.net";
```

Pick a subdomain unique to your organization, unlikely to be picked by another organization that uses Adobe Analytics. Make sure that all implementations in your organization use the same tracking server. It can be helpful to maintain this information in a [solution design document](../../prepare/solution-design.md).
