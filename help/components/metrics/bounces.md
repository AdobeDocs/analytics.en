# Bounces

The 'Bounces' metric shows the number of visits that contained exactly one hit. You can use this metric to understand the ratio of bounce to non-bounce traffic you get, to see the top entry pages that cause visitors to bounce, or to see how the total number of bounces trend over time.

## Hits that qualify for this metric

If a visit consists of exactly one hit, the hit is considered a bounce.

>[!NOTE] If a visitor fires both a page view and link tracking call, the visit is not considered a bounce. Consider using [Single page visits](single-page-visits.md) instead.
