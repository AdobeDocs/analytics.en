# Color legends

Color legends color-code visualizations by metrics such as Conversion and Retention and can be used in almost every workspace.

Linking business metrics to color makes it much easier to spot anomalies, exceptions, and trends. When a color legend is activated within a workspace, right-click within the legend to select the metric that you want to color-code. The visualizations within that workspace are then color-coded based on the metric displayed in the color legend. You can switch between metrics used for coloring all of the visualizations in the current workspace.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you do not select a metric in the color legend, all visualizations appear blue.
