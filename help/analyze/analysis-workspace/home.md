## Log in to Adobe Analytics {#login}

To start using Analysis Workspace, log in to Adobe Analytics by going to [experience.adobe.com/analytics](https://experience.adobe.com/analytics). The Projects page is shown by default, unless a specific project has been selected for you.

## Create a project {#new-project}

An analysis in Analysis Workspace is referred to as a [project](help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md).  

For information about how to create a project in Analysis Workspace, see [Create projects](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/create-projects.md).

## The building blocks of Analysis Workspace project {#analysis}

The building blocks you use to create a project in Analysis Workspace are panels, tables, visualizations, and components.

### Panels

**Panels** are used to organize your analysis within a project and can contain many tables & visualizations. Many of the panels provided in Analysis Workspace generate a full set of analyses based on a few user inputs. On the far left rail, select the top **[!UICONTROL Panels]** icon to see a full list of [panels](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/panels/panels.html) available.

### Visualizations

**Visualizations**, such as a bar or line chart, can be used to visually bring data to life. On the far left rail, select the middle **[!UICONTROL Visualizations]** icon to see the full list of [visualizations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-analysis-visualizations.html) available.

### Components

[Components](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/analysis-workspace-components.md) in Analysis Workspace consist of the following:

* Dimensions

* Metrics

* Segments

* Date ranges

See [Components overview](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/analysis-workspace-components.md) to learn more about each of these component types. 

Each of these component types can be added to a visualization (such as a **[!UICONTROL Freeform table](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/freeform-table.md)**) to start answering your business questions. 

After you understand component terminology, you can begin dragging components into visualizations (including Freeform tables) to [build your analysis](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/t-freeform-project.html).
