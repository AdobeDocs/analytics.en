# Processing Rules

Processing rules simplify data collection and manage content as it is sent to reports.

Processing rules help simplify interaction with IT groups and Web developers by providing an interface to:

* Set an event on the product overview page 
* Populate campaign with a query string parameter 
* Concatenate category and page name in a prop for easier reporting 
* Copy an eVar into a prop to see paths 
* Clean up misspelled site sections 
* Pull internal search terms or a campaign ID from the query string into an eVar
