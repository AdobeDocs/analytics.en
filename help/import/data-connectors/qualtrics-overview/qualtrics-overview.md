# Qualtrics Data Connector for Adobe Analytics{#qualtrics-data-connector-for-adobe-analytics}

This integration combines the customer research capabilities of the Qualtrics Research Suite with the rich data you are collecting within Adobe Analytics to create powerful analytics and optimization opportunities for your organization.

This two-way integration first connects the Qualtrics survey response data with your visitor clickstream data. It then injects relevant behavioral actions and attributes, from Adobe Analytics, back into the Qualtrics survey reporting.

## Key Benefits and Features{#key-benefits-and-features}
