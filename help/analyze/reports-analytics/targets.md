# [!UICONTROL Targets] {#concept_6516E81923E845198B7FC5D8F81DC35C}

[!UICONTROL Targets] let you measure your website performance and track progress against target goals. For example, you might want to increase the number of visitors that come from a geographic region, the revenue per order, or the number of hits that come from a specific referrer.

When you create targets, you select which attribute metrics or eVars you want to measure or you can choose to measure your entire site against your selected metric.

For example, you can measure the number of unique visitors to your website, and use it as a target. In this case, choose the entire website. However, if you want to target the number of unique visitors to your website from Chicago, you can specify that eVar rather than look at your entire site.

Descriptions of the fields and options on the [!UICONTROL Add/Edit Target] page.

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [!UICONTROL Target Name] | Provide a target name, which is displayed on the [!UICONTROL Manage Targets] page. |
| [!UICONTROL Apply To] | Lets you apply the target to the entire site or to a selected attribute or eVar. |
| [!UICONTROL Select Item] | Displays the selection form for the selected attribute or eVar, so that you can perform an [!UICONTROL Advanced] search for related items. For example, if you select the eVar [!UICONTROL Countries], the item list lets you specify which country. If you select the eVar [!UICONTROL Products], the item list lets you specify which product. Custom insight variables are also listed in the menu. If you have a custom insight variable set up to measure visitor age ranges, then the item list displays the ranges of the ages, such as 18-24, 25-35, and so on. |
| [!UICONTROL Metric] | Lets you apply the target to a metric. This menu displays only those metrics that apply to a given eVar. For example, if you select [!UICONTROL Products] as the eVar, a metric such as [!UICONTROL Page Exits] does not apply to it. The [!UICONTROL Page Exits] metric can apply to a web page eVar. |
| [!UICONTROL Period] | Lets you define the [!UICONTROL Date Range] and [!UICONTROL Granularity] settings of the target. Depending on your date range specifications, some granularity options do not apply. When typing values for your metrics, type a value for each granularity setting. For example, if your date range is the month of February, and your granularity selection is weekly, type a value for each week of the month of February. [!UICONTROL Target] reports display for each granularity setting. |
| [!UICONTROL Values] | Lets you specify target values for the time period and the selected metric. These values are the target numbers that you are attempting to reach. For example, if the target were based on revenue, and you were aiming for $10,000 of revenue for a given month, you would enter 10000 in the value field for the month. |
