The area visualization has a standard and stacked option.

## Area {#area}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD034 -->

>title="Area graph"
>abstract="Create an area graph visualization to represent the intersection of multiple metrics."

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD034 -->


This visualization is like a line graph, but with a colored area below the line. Use an area graph when you have multiple metrics and want to visualize the area expressed by the intersection of two or more metrics.

## Area stacked {#area-stacked}

This visualization is like an Area Chart, but each series begins at the top of the previous series.

A new visualization setting on area stacked visualizations turns the chart into a "100% stacked" visualization.
