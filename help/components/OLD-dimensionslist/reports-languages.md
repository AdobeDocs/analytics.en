We populate this report based on the accept-language portion of the http header request. The language-accept HTTP header is configured as part of each browser's language preference settings:

[https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-lang-priorities.en.php](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-lang-priorities.en.php)

If a browser does not have a language specified, or if the browser returns a language ID=0, the report will show "Unspecified" in the graph. Browser support for this setting can affect the number of "Unspecified" returns.

Some line items in this report include regions. These are region subtags.
