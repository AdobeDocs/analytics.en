## Advantages of exporting to the cloud {#advantages}

Exporting Adobe Analytics data to the cloud allows you to: 

* Export to a shared location, such as Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon S3.

* Store large amounts of historical data.

  This type of data can be used to detect long-term trends in order to gain business intelligence, and ultimately lead to better business decision-making.

* Include calculated metrics in the exported Adobe Analytics data. 

* Structure data output as concatenated values. 

* Export one-time or on a schedule.

* Export files in Excel, PDF, or CSV format. 

* Export data blocks that include multiple dimensions.

## Export requirements {#export-requirements}

### Minimum requirements

Make sure that your data blocks, your environment, and your permissions meet the following requirements:

* **Data blocks:** All data blocks must include at least one component to a column, row, or value.

* **Environment:** Ensure that the [IP addresses](/help/technotes/ip-addresses.md) and [Domains](/help/technotes/domains.md) used by Adobe Analytics are allowed through their organization's firewall.


<!--
## Manage exports

After data is exported from Analysis Workspace, you can edit, re-export, duplicate, tag, or delete existing exports, as described in [Manage exports](/help/components/exports/manage-exports.md).

## Manage scheduled workbooks

For information about managing workbooks that are already scheduled, see [Manage scheduled workbooks](/help/analyze/report-builder/manage-schedules-reportbuilder.md).
