# Day of year

The 'Day of year' dimension reports the numeric day of any given year as a dimension item. This report is valuable if you want a report broken out by the day of the year, but do not want a static date as dimension items.

## Populate this dimension with data

This dimension works out of the box for all implementations. If a report suite contains data, this dimension works.

## Dimension items

Dimension items include the numbers `1` (January 1) to `366` (December 31 on leap year), representing the day of the year that the hit occurred on.
