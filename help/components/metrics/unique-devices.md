## Unique devices

The 'Unique devices' metric is a [Cross-device analytics](../cda/overview.md) metric that counts the number of post-stitched devices.

## How this metric is calculated

For all [People](people.md), count the number of devices per person. This metric typically matches closely with [Unique visitors](unique-visitors.md) in a non-CDA report suite. Differences can happen when a shared device maps to multiple people. In this scenario, one unique visitor is counted while multiple unique devices is counted.
