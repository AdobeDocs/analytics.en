# charSet

The `charSet` variable is used by Adobe to convert incoming data into UTF-8 for storage and reporting by Analytics. Most sites do not need to set this variable.

Set this variable only if you see garbled values ([mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake)) in reports. You can set this variable on a page-by-page basis if your site uses different encodings on different pages.

## Character Set in the Web SDK

The Web SDK currently supports only UTF-8, and does not provide options to change encoding.

## Character Set in the Adobe Analytics extension

Character Set is a field under the [!UICONTROL General] accordion when configuring the Adobe Analytics extension in Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection.

1. Log in to [Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](https://experience.adobe.com/data-collection) using your AdobeID credentials.
1. Click the desired tag property.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click the **[!UICONTROL Configure]** button under Adobe Analytics.
1. Expand the [!UICONTROL General] accordion, which reveals the [!UICONTROL Character Set] field.

You can use either a preset character set or a custom character set. Avoid changing the value from `UTF-8` unless you see garbled values in reports.

## s.charSet in AppMeasurement and the Analytics extension custom code editor

The `charSet` variable is a string. If you have garbled values in Adobe Analytics, set this variable to the same value as the `<meta charset="">` HTML tag on your site.

```js
s.charSet = "UTF-8";
```
