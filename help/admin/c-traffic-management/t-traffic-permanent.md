# Specify permanent traffic increase

The Permanent Traffic sections lets you change expected traffic levels so Adobe can reassign resources to handle the new traffic level.

Please read the information about [Required Lead Time for Traffic Increases](/help/admin/c-traffic-management/traffic-lead-time.md) before you specify a permanent traffic increase.

1. Open the Report Suite Manager by clicking **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL All admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Report suites]**.
1. Select a report suite.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Edit Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Traffic Management]** > **[!UICONTROL Permanent Traffic]**.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL New Expected Daily Page Views]** field, specify the total expected daily page views for the new traffic level.

   Make sure to specify the total expected page views, not just the additional page views.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Effective Date]** field, specify the date when you expect the new traffic level to start, then click **[!UICONTROL Submit]**.
