# Current Adobe Analytics release notes

**Last update**: January 25, 2023

Adobe Analytics releases operate on a [continuous delivery model](releases.md) which allows for a more scalable, phased approach to feature deployment. Accordingly, these release notes get updated several times a month. Please check them regularly.

## New or updated features in Adobe Analytics

| **Auto-save new projects** | Analysis Workspace now auto-saves newly created projects.

## Important notices for Adobe Analytics administrators

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **Update to device lookups due to Google Client Hints** | January 25, 2023 | The use of client hints in device lookup will start on **February 16, 2023**. <p> <p>As of October 2022, it is possible to collect client hints with either the Web SDK or AppMeasurement JavaScript libraries. But client hints will not be incorporated into device lookup until February 2023. At that time, Adobe will begin using client hints in addition to the User-Agent when deriving certain device information for hits coming from Chromium browsers, such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. This is in response to Google's plan to gradually reduce the information presented from the User-Agent string in lieu of data passed via client hints. <p> <p>As part of this change, Adobe will use Device Atlas for all device lookups related to User-Agent. [Learn more](/help/technotes/client-hints.md)|
| **Pausing scheduled reports in Reports & Analytics** | January 6, 2023 | This is a reminder that Adobe will deprecate these features on **Jan 31, 2023**. Please note that expiration windows for both reports and data extracts will continue to be limited to nine months; report and data extract delivery will pause at the end of this period unless the schedule is reactivated.<p>To reiterate, these features will be deprecated on January 31, 2023. Before this date, you must migrate your scheduled reporting to one of the other mechanisms available to you in Adobe Analytics. For additional questions or support, please reach out to Adobe Customer Care. [Learn more](/help/analyze/reports-analytics/scheduled-reports-eol.md) |
| **Pausing scheduled tasks in Report Builder** | January 6, 2023 | On **January 31, 2023**, Adobe will roll out changes to scheduled tasks in Report Builder as part of our performance and delivery optimization efforts. These changes include removing the ability to have scheduled deliveries "end after x occurrences."<p>You can continue to schedule hourly Report Builder tasks and have them end after a maximum of 99 occurrences. Please note that the rollback only applies to hourly tasks; the "end after x occurrences" will remain unavailable for all other delivery intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly). Please note that this option will be deprecated on January 31, 2023. For more questions or support, please reach out to Adobe Customer Care. [Learn more](/help/analyze/report-builder/r-arb-scheduled-reports.md)|
| **Improved IP-to-geolocation mapping** | January 4, 2023 | Our vendor for IP lookups, Digital Element, is upgrading to a new improved dataset (NetAcuity Pulse) for IP-to-geolocation mapping. Originally planned for October 2022, Adobe Analytics will adopt this new dataset on **January 11, 2023**. The new database will be more accurate than previous versions. Some IP-to-geo mappings will change/improve when the new database is adopted.<p>All Adobe Analytics tools (Analysis Workspace, Reports & Analytics, Reporting API, Data Warehouse, LiveStream, Analytics Data Feeds, and so on) will automatically take advantage of the new improved mappings. There will be no change in the format of the data in data feeds. CJA data provided through the Analytics Source Connector will automatically take advantage of the new mappings. |
| **Update to new NetAcuity carrier database** | January 4, 2023 | This update, originally planned for on October 5, 2022, will now happen on **January 11, 2023**. Carrier-related information stored in the `carrier` field in Adobe Analytics Data Warehouse and Analytics Data Feeds will change. Historically, the data format in that column has been `<domain>:<ISP>`. Adobe has maintained an internal lookup table to map these `<domain>:<ISP>` values into carrier names for reporting purposes in Adobe Analytics reporting tools (Analysis Workspace, Reports & Analytics, Reporting API, Data Warehouse, LiveStream, etc.). The lookup file (`carrier.tsv`) is also provided with Data Feeds so that you can use the same mappings.<p>This update enhances our carrier mappings by using a more accurate carrier database from NetAcuity. The format of the data in the carrier column in Data Feeds will change going forward. Instead of `<domain>:<ISP>`, it will contain a carrier name. Adobe will continue to use the lookup table in order to maintain as much continuity with past reporting as possible. Reporting tools where the lookups are applied by Adobe (Analysis Workspace, Reports & Analytics, reporting API, data warehouse, LiveStream, etc.) will benefit from more accurate mappings. Some mappings – especially for international domains and ISPs – will change more than others when Adobe adopts the new database. The data feeds carrier lookup file (`carrier.tsv`) will maintain the old mappings and add the new mappings.<p>The Analytics Source Connector does not currently map the carrier field, so carrier reporting is not currently available in Experience Platform, CJA, and so on. Therefore, use of the new carrier database will not impact anything in Experience Platform that is based on data provided by the Analytics Source Connector. |
| **Updated guidelines for traffic spike notifications** | November 18, 2022 | Former guidelines were based strictly on hit volumes. The [new guidelines](/help/admin/admin/c-manage-report-suites/c-edit-report-suites/c-traffic-management/t-traffic-schedule-spike.md) are based on a combination of report suite size and percent increase. |
