# Building a project

** [!UICONTROL  Analytics] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  Workspace] ** 

You can create a robust Analytics project based on any combination of visualizations, report components, and data tables. It brings many of the table builder features from Ad Hoc Analysis into Analytics. 

In Analysis Workspace, you can compare and dissect data in ways not previously possible. For example, configure ranked reports and make immediate iterative changes to the data query, and then access and manipulate the values at the reporting level. 

The query goes directly to the reporting engineâ€”you can make changes inline without bringing up other reports to create your analysis. Results return immediately, with no browser refresh. 

## Workspace project list page {#section_39AA007D7C384F4E869F842F1C7B11F8}

When you first go to  ** [!UICONTROL  Analytics] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  Workspace] ** , the page lists all the projects you own or have been granted access to. You can set this page to be your Adobe Analytics landing page by clicking ** [!UICONTROL  Set as Landing Page] **. (If you don't see this option, as in the screen shot below, it is already your landing page.)
