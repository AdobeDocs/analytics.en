# Statistical display in tables

The statistical display lets you analyze how data relates to each other in a multi-dimensional table.

 For example, you might want to know whether purchases of a red shoe are statistically related to purchases of a red belt or a different color belt. The statistic shows you whether the relationship is more than you expected, or less than you expected.

On the top border of a table, right-click **[!UICONTROL Display As]** > **[!UICONTROL Stats]**.
