# Segments

Segments are custom subsets of data, or data filtered by rules that you create.

Segments are based on:

* Hits 
* Visitors 
* Visits

For information about using segments for cross-device visitor identification, see [Create Segments](../js-implementation/xdevice-visid/segments.md#concept_77F0A880A6BA4A919A233DAF9D0D6FB5).
