# Modify metrics - field definitions

Field descriptions for configuring metrics in Report Builder.

| Fields | Definitions |
|--- |--- |
|Subtotal (this request)|The subtotal of the response received from the server. Meaning, it provides the total number of items for line item metrics over a date range selected according to the elements you specify. When you click this option, data for all items with the specified starting rank and number of entries is totaled.  This option is available only if you have selected a metric that you can aggregate. Subtotals presented still depend on any other criteria or filter you set in step 2 of the  Request Wizard. A suggested use of Subtotal (this request) is in combination with filtering.|
|Average|Averages the item by day, week, or month. You can also specify none.  For example, if you select the  Paths metric and map the names of the paths to the spreadsheet, you can choose to display the number of visits to the content path for a given time period as either the raw data (actual number of visits / time period), or as an average (number of visits / time period) per day, per week or per month.|
|Prepend Text|Adds a prefix of numeric or string values in the cell.|
|Postpend Text|Appends a numeric or string values in the cell.|
