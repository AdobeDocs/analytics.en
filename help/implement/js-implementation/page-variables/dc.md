# dc

(Deprecated) The  variable lets you select the data center to which your data is sent.

<!-- 

dc.xml

 -->

> [!NOTE] The dc variable is deprecated. You should set *`trackingServer`* for all implementations to the value that is generated by [!UICONTROL Code Manager] in s_code.js.

|  Max Size  | Debugger Parameter  | Reports Populated  | Default Value  |
|---|---|---|---|
|  N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | 112  |

The data center is identified in the *`dc`* variable in order to match [!UICONTROL ActionSource].
