# Server Call Usage alerts

When you set up an alert, it applies to all report suites in all login companies of a Billing company.

## Overview

A new alert category called **[!UICONTROL Server Calls Usage Alert]** is part of the existing [Alert Management](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/analysis-workspace/intellligent_alerts.html) user interface.

It is pre-populated with **1 default alert** that appears within any login company that has access to the Server Call Usage feature. This alerts triggers a notification addressed to all the login company's admins if one of the following criteria is satisfied:

* "Any" server call usage that "is above or equals" 100% for any server-call type you are entitled to, OR 
* "Any" server call usage that "is above or equals" 90% for any server-call type you are entitled to, OR 
* "Any" server call usage that "is above or equals" 75% for any server-call type you are entitled to, AND "Usage period spent" "is below or equals" 75% of Usage period.
