# Create new rule

Steps that describe how to create rules in Dynamic Tag Management.

1. [Create Web Property](/help/implement/other/dtm/t-create-web-property.md), if you haven't done so already.
1. In the web property, click the **[!UICONTROL Rules]** tab.
1. Select the type of rule you wish to create from the left navigation pane, such as Event Based Rules or Page Load Rules.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create New Rule]**.
1. Name the rule and select a category, if you wish.
1. Next, set up the condition(s) for the rule. The setup differs depending on the type of rule you are implementing.

    * **Event-based rule:** [Create conditions for event-based rules](/help/implement/other/dtm/c-rules/t-rules-event-conditions.md)
    * **Page Load rule:** [Create conditions for page-load rules](/help/implement/other/dtm/c-rules/t-rules-page-conditions.md)
    * **Direct Call rule:** [Create conditions for direct-call rules](/help/implement/other/dtm/c-rules/t-rules-direct-conditions.md)

   The category field is only for your own organizational purposes and is not required. You can delete categories by clicking the x icon in the category.
1. [Set up actions for the condition to trigger](/help/implement/other/dtm/c-rules/t-rules-actions.md).
