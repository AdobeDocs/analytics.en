# Classifications importer - overview

Use the importer to upload classifications into Adobe Analytics. You can also export the data for updating prior to an import.

**[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Classification Importer]**

The data that you import using the import tool must be in a specific format. Adobe provides you with the option to download a data template with all the proper header details in a tab-delimited data file. You can add your new data to this template and then import the data file in the browser, using FTP.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe recommends that you limit the number of import and export columns to 30.

See [Numeric 2 Classifications](../../../components/c-classifications2/c-numeric-2/c-numeric-2-classifications.md#concept_71024B7B91DF4E909076062AB1380D8B) for information about uploading data using numeric 2 classifications.
