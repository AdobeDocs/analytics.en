| **37-month expiration of Purchase IDs and Event IDs (event serialization)**  | July 10,2023 | An upcoming release of the Analytics Hit processing engine, targeted for release on **July 13, 2023**, will start enforcing a 37-month expiration of Purchase IDs and Event IDs (event serialization). Currently, Purchase IDs and Event IDs never expire in Adobe Analytics. Once a Purchase ID or Event ID is seen/used, then any future hit, no matter when, will have that purchase or event marked as a duplicate. With the new processing engine release:<ul><li>Purchase IDs and Event IDs always expire after 37 months.</li><li>If it has been 37 months since the Purchase ID or Event ID was seen, it is no longer considered a duplicate purchase or event.</li><li> If you are "reusing" Purchase IDs or Event IDs from more than 37 months ago, they are no longer considered duplicates.</li></ul> |
| **Migration to Adobe I/O OAuth Server-to-Server credentials** | May 11, 2023 | Adobe Analytics API and Livestream customers using Adobe I/O JWT credentials must migrate to Adobe I/O OAuth Server-to-Server credentials by **January 1, 2025**.

The following IP address ranges should be added to your firewall configuration in order to allow access: <ul><li>130.248.244.32/29</li><li>130.248.244.40/29</li></ul> |
| **Device lookup processes now use a third party for all device lookups** | March 3, 2023 |On March 2, 2023, as part of the support rollout for client hints, we updated our device lookup processes to use a third party for all device lookups. Previously, we had used the third party only for mobile device lookups. As part of that rollout, some desktop operating systems were incorrectly labelled with the text "mobile" (e.g. "Mobile OS X 10.15.7" instead of "OS X 10.15.7 ").<p>During Adobe's April release we will correct these names. Analytics and Customer Journey Analytics reporting will be updated retroactively, since their reporting looks up operating system name based on an ID which is recorded as part of the event data. Once the lookup value corresponding to an ID is updated, all reporting will be corrected, including historical data. For [!UICONTROL Data Feeds] customers, the changes are retroactive if you are using a similar lookup process at the time of reporting. However, if you store the operating system value in your event data, reporting will be updated going forward only. See [Operating System](/help/components/dimensions/operating-systems.md) for more details. |

## AppMeasurement

For the latest updates on AppMeasurement releases (Version 2.23.0), please refer to [AppMeasurement for JavaScript release notes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/appmeasurement-updates.html).


## April 2023 {#april23}

| Feature | Description | [Rollout starts](releases.md) | [General Availability](releases.md) |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| **Backfill for non-production sandboxes** | When creating an Analytics Source Connector data flow in a non-production sandbox,  the backfill in non-production sandboxes will be limited to 3 months. It will remain at 13 months for production sandboxes. | N/A | April 26, 2023 | 
| **Row/column filtering for Analytics Source Connector streaming** | The Analytics Source Connector in Adobe Experience Platform now allows for filtering of Analytics data which is used to populate profiles in [Real-Time Customer Profile](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/profile/home.html?lang=en). Row-level filtering helps reduce the number of events associated with profiles. Column-level filtering helps reduce the richness of the events themselves, thus enabling you to optimize the use of profile entitlements. This filtering applies only to data sent to Real-Time Customer Profile and [Identity Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/identity/home.html?lang=en). **Filtering does not impact the data which is sent to Data Lake for use in applications such as Customer Journey Analytics**. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sources/ui-tutorials/create/adobe-applications/analytics.html?lang=en#filtering-for-profile) | N/A | March 29, 2023 |
| **Partial support for Activity Map with Web SDK** | Starting with Web SDK version 2.15.0, we started populating Activity Map data when link tracking is enabled. This allows Web SDK users to get Activity Map reporting if they have link tracking enabled with the Web SDK and Activity Map configured in Analytics.<p>Enabling link tracking with Web SDK currently sends link events when a customer navigates from one page to the next. This is different from how AppMeasurement works and can potentially result in extra billable hits sent to Adobe. Learn more [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/data-collection/track-links.html) and [here](/help/analyze/activity-map/activitymap-getting-started/activitymap-getting-started-admins/activitymap-enable.md)| N/A | March 31, 2023 |
| **IP obfuscation for Experience Edge** | Experience Edge will support IP obfuscation for data sent directly to Adobe Experience Platform. This benefits customers who send data directly to Platform for use in Customer Journey Analyticstomer Journey Analytics or other Platform solutions. IP obfuscation is configured at the data stream level. It supports removing the last octet or the whole IP address.<p>**Note**: Obfuscation does NOT apply to data sent to Adobe Analytics. Analytics continues to get the full IP. IP processing continues to be done in Analytics separately. In the future, we plan on allowing Analytics data to be obfuscated at the Edge. | N/A | Adobe Experience Platform release on April 26, 2023 |
| **Data Dictionary in Analysis Workspace** | The Data Dictionary helps both users and administrators keep track of, manage, and better understand the components (dimensions, metrics) in their Analytics environment. [Learn more](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/data-dictionary/data-dictionary-overview.md) | March 15, 2023 | March 29, 2023 |
| **Link sharing for projects (no login required)** | <p>You can now share read-only links to Analysis Workspace projects with people who don't have access to Adobe Analytics. This includes sharing with people outside of your organization, or those within your organization who are not provisioned for Adobe Analytics. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/curate-share/share-projects.html?lang=en#share-public-link)</p> <p>This functionality is enabled by default and can be disabled by the system administrator. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/user-preferences.html?lang=en#company-preferences)</p> | May 3, 2023 | June 2023 |
| **2 new endpoint guides for the Adobe Analytics 2.0 API** |<ul><li>[Analytics Dimensions API](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/2.0/guides/endpoints/dimensions/)</li><li>[Analytics Metrics API](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/2.0/guides/endpoints/metrics/)</li></ul> | N/A | April 10, 2023 |

## Important notices for Adobe Analytics administrators

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **Notice:  New IPs used by Adobe Analytics Data Feeds and Data Warehouse egress in the London Data Center** | April 27, 2023 |For customers in the London Data Center that have Data Feed requests and/or Data Warehouse reports being delivered to an FTP/SFTP service, the following IP address ranges should be added to your firewall configuration in order to allow access: <ul><li>130.248.244.32/29</li><li>130.248.244.40/29</li></ul> |
| **Device lookup processes now use a third party for all device lookups** | March 3, 2023 |On March 2, 2023, as part of the support rollout for client hints, we updated our device lookup processes to use a third party for all device lookups. Previously, we had used the third party only for mobile device lookups. As part of that rollout, some desktop operating systems were incorrectly labelled with the text "mobile" (e.g. "Mobile OS X 10.15.7" instead of "OS X 10.15.7 ").<p>During Adobe's April release we will correct these names. Analytics and Customer Journey Analytics reporting will be updated retroactively, since their reporting looks up operating system name based on an ID which is recorded as part of the event data. Once the lookup value corresponding to an ID is updated, all reporting will be corrected, including historical data. For [!UICONTROL Data Feeds] customers, the change are retroactive if you are using a similar lookup process at the time of reporting. However, if you store the operating system value in your event data, reporting will be updated going forward only. See [Operating System](/help/components/dimensions/operating-systems.md) for more details. |
| **Update to device lookups due to Google Client Hints** | February 27, 2023 | The use of client hints, planned for February 16, 2023, was postponed in order to better ensure the quality of device lookups using hints. We proceeded with the first phase of the release for support of Client Hints on February 27, 2023. The second and final phase of the release was completed on Thursday, March 2, 2023. [Learn more](/help/technotes/client-hints.md)|
| **Automatic migration to Classification set architecture** | February 8, 2023 | Over the next several months, Adobe plans to migrate all classifications across all organizations to the latest classification architecture. The last customers to migrate is estimated to happen in May 2023. No customer action is required, and no down time is expected. This new architecture has many benefits, including:<ul><li>Significantly reduced processing time (72 hours → 24 hours)</li><li>The ability to use the [Classification sets](/help/components/classifications/sets/overview.md) UI</li><li>The option to use classification data in Adobe Experience Platform in the future through the [Adobe Analytics source connector for classification data](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sources/connectors/adobe-applications/classifications.html)</li></ul>Note the following changes that can potentially impact your organization's workflow:<ul><li>When using the browser or FTP import, '[!UICONTROL Overwrite on conflict]' is always enabled.</li><li>When using the browser or FTP import, the option to export immediately after import is no longer supported.</li><li>The Analytics 2.0 API `GetDimensions` endpoint now returns string identifiers for classifications instead of numeric identifiers. Numeric identifiers can still be used, but Adobe recommends using the new string identifiers where possible. Numeric identifiers can be retrieved by using the `?expansion=hidden` query string parameter.</li></ul>Contact Adobe Customer Care if you want a more specific migration schedule for your organization, or have questions/concerns around this migration.

| ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| **Updated user interface for Data Privacy labels**  | The updated interface streamlines the process of creating, managing, and editing data privacy labels for report suite components. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/data-governance/data-labels/gdpr-setup-reportsuite.html?lang=en)| N/A | February 8, 2023 |
| **Hide comparison date ranges in Mobile Scorecards** |  With Mobile Scorecards, you can toggle the **[!UICONTROL Include comparison dates]** setting to view or hide comparison dates. | N/A | February 8, 2023 |
| **Calendar updates in Workspace** |<ul><li>Anchor Panel Dates: You can make the date range components relative to the panel calendar. [Learn more](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/calendar-date-ranges/calendar.md#relative-panel-dates)</li><li>Calendar styling updates: The calendar styles throughout the UI have been upgraded to present a more consistent and easy-to-use workflow.</li><li>Calendar formula updates: If you use relative dates, all calendar formulas will reflect the start of the panel date range. [Learn more](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/calendar-date-ranges/calendar.md#formula-relative-dates)</li></ul> | N/A |  February 8, 2023 |
| **Panel date range updates** |  In Workspace, we added the following improvements:<ul><li>Starting with the February release, dimension items and data previews are based on the panel date range and not the last 90 days. </li><li>All dimension items listed are based on data within the panel date range. If a dimension item has data outside the date range, you can show additional data beyond the date range at the bottom of the list.</li><li>Dimensions that don't have data can be displayed in the left rail. Click the show more options to view dimension items with data outside the panel date range.</li><li>Data previews in the segment and calculated metric builders are based on the panel date range unless accessed from the component managers, which don't have an associated panel and are still based on the last 90 days.</li><li>Data previews display data or components based on the panel date range.</li></ul>| N/A | February 8, 2023 |
| **Row/column filtering for Adobe Analytics Source Connector streaming** | The Analytics Source Connector in Adobe Experience Platform now allows for filtering of Analytics data which is used to populate profiles in [Real-Time Customer Profile](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/profile/home.html?lang=en). Row-level filtering helps reduce the number of events associated with profiles. Column-level filtering helps reduce the richness of the events themselves, thus enabling you to optimize the use of profile entitlements. This filtering applies only to data sent to Real-Time Customer Profile and [Identity Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/identity/home.html?lang=en). **Filtering does not impact the data which is sent to Data Lake for use in applications such as Customer Journey Analytics**. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sources/ui-tutorials/create/adobe-applications/analytics.html?lang=en#filtering-for-profile) | N/A | Rescheduled to March 29, 2023 |

### Important notices for Adobe Analytics administrators

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **Update to device lookups due to Google Client Hints** | January 25, 2023 | The use of client hints in device lookup will start on **February 16, 2023**. <p> <p>As of October 2022, it is possible to collect client hints with either the Web SDK or AppMeasurement JavaScript libraries. But client hints will not be incorporated into device lookup until February 2023. At that time, Adobe will begin using client hints in addition to the User-Agent when deriving certain device information for hits coming from Chromium browsers, such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. This is in response to Google's plan to gradually reduce the information presented from the User-Agent string in lieu of data passed via client hints. <p> <p>As part of this change, Adobe will use Device Atlas for all device lookups related to User-Agent. [Learn more](/help/technotes/client-hints.md)|
| **Pausing scheduled reports in Reports & Analytics** | January 6, 2023 | This is a reminder that Adobe will deprecate these features on **Jan 31, 2023**. Please note that expiration windows for both reports and data extracts will continue to be limited to nine months; report and data extract delivery will pause at the end of this period unless the schedule is reactivated.<p>To reiterate, these features will be deprecated on January 31, 2023. Before this date, you must migrate your scheduled reporting to one of the other mechanisms available to you in Adobe Analytics. For additional questions or support, please reach out to Adobe Customer Care. [Learn more](/help/analyze/reports-analytics/scheduled-reports-eol.md) |
| **Pausing scheduled tasks in Report Builder** | January 6, 2023 | On **January 31, 2023**, Adobe will roll out changes to scheduled tasks in Report Builder as part of our performance and delivery optimization efforts. These changes include removing the ability to have scheduled deliveries "end after x occurrences."<p>You can continue to schedule hourly Report Builder tasks and have them end after a maximum of 99 occurrences. Please note that the rollback only applies to hourly tasks; the "end after x occurrences" will remain unavailable for all other delivery intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly). Please note that this option will be deprecated on January 31, 2023. For more questions or support, please reach out to Adobe Customer Care. [Learn more](/help/analyze/report-builder/r-arb-scheduled-reports.md)|
| **Improved IP-to-geolocation mapping** | January 4, 2023 | Our vendor for IP lookups, Digital Element, is upgrading to a new improved dataset (NetAcuity Pulse) for IP-to-geolocation mapping. Originally planned for October 2022, Adobe Analytics adopts this new dataset on **January 11, 2023**. The new database is more accurate than previous versions. Some IP-to-geo mappings change/improve when the new database is adopted.<p>All Adobe Analytics tools (Analysis Workspace, Reports & Analytics, Reporting API, Data Warehouse, LiveStream, Analytics Data Feeds, and so on) automatically take advantage of the new improved mappings. There is no change in the format of the data in data feeds. Customer Journey Analytics data provided through the Analytics Source Connector automatically takes advantage of the new mappings. |
| **Update to new NetAcuity carrier database** | January 4, 2023 | This update, originally planned for on October 5, 2022, is now slated for **January 11, 2023**. Carrier-related information stored in the `carrier` field in Adobe Analytics Data Warehouse and Analytics Data Feeds will change. Historically, the data format in that column has been `<domain>:<ISP>`. Adobe has maintained an internal lookup table to map these `<domain>:<ISP>` values into carrier names for reporting purposes in Adobe Analytics reporting tools (Analysis Workspace, Reports & Analytics, Reporting API, Data Warehouse, LiveStream, etc.). The lookup file (`carrier.tsv`) is also provided with Data Feeds so that you can use the same mappings.<p>This update enhances our carrier mappings by using a more accurate carrier database from NetAcuity. The format of the data in the carrier column in Data Feeds changes going forward. Instead of `<domain>:<ISP>`, it contains a carrier name. Adobe continues to use the lookup table in order to maintain as much continuity with past reporting as possible. Reporting tools where the lookups are applied by Adobe (Analysis Workspace, Reports & Analytics, reporting API, data warehouse, LiveStream, etc.) benefits from more accurate mappings. Some mappings – especially for international domains and ISPs – changes more than others when Adobe adopts the new database. The data feeds carrier lookup file (`carrier.tsv`) maintains the old mappings and adds the new mappings.<p>The Analytics Source Connector does not currently map the carrier field, so carrier reporting is not currently available in Experience Platform, Customer Journey Analytics, and so on. Therefore, use of the new carrier database does not impact anything in Experience Platform that is based on data provided by the Analytics Source Connector. |
| **Updated guidelines for traffic spike notifications** | November 18, 2022 | Former guidelines were based strictly on hit volumes. The [new guidelines](/help/admin/admin/c-manage-report-suites/c-edit-report-suites/c-traffic-management/t-traffic-schedule-spike.md) are based on a combination of report suite size and percent increase. |
