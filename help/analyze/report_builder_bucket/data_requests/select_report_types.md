# Report types

You can choose only one base report type for a range of spreadsheet cells. If you are editing a previously created request, you can change the report type on the [!UICONTROL  Request Wizard: Step 1] window without having to reconfigure other settings in the request. 

You can search for reports using the auto-complete search bar. Once you have selected a report from this control, the tree view will automatically select the matching node.
