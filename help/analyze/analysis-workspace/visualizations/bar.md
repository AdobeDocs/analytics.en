# Bar and bar stacked

This visualization shows vertical bars representing various values across one or more metrics.

A granularity drop-down in the visualization settings lets you change a trended visualization (e.g. line, bar) from daily to weekly to monthly, etc.

## Bar stacked {#section_9EA83779AE964635907EE5031A785A49}

This visualization is like a bar chart, but with the series bars stacked on top of each other.
