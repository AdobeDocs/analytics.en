# Adobe plug-in: cleanStr

{{plug-in}}

The `cleanStr` plug-in removes or replaces all unnecessary characters from a string, including HTML tag characters, extra whitespaces, tabs, and newline/carriage returns. It also replaces left/right single quotes with straight single quotes (`'`). Adobe recommends using this plug-in if you want to remove unnecessary characters from variable values and the 'Clean text' feature in Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection does not fulfill your implementation needs. This plug-in is not necessary if the collected data does not contain unnecessary characters, or if the 'Clean text' feature in Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection is sufficient.

## Install the plug-in using the Web SDK or Web SDK extension

This plug-in is not yet supported for use within the Web SDK.

## Install the plug-in using the Adobe Analytics extension

Adobe offers an extension that allows you to use most commonly-used plug-ins with Adobe Analytics.

1. Log in to [Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](https://experience.adobe.com/data-collection) using your AdobeID credentials.
1. Click the desired tag property.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click on the [!UICONTROL Catalog] button
1. Install and publish the [!UICONTROL Common Analytics Plugins] extension
1. If you haven't already, create a rule labeled "Initialize Plug-ins" with the following configuration:
    * Condition: None
    * Event: Core â€“ Library Loaded (Page Top)
1. Add an action to the above rule with the following configuration:
    * Extension: Common Analytics Plugins
    * Action Type: Initialize cleanStr
1. Save and publish the changes to the rule.

## Install the plug-in using custom code editor

If you do not want to use the Common Analytics Plugins plug-in extension, you can use the custom code editor.

1. Log in to [Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](https://experience.adobe.com/data-collection) using your AdobeID credentials.
1. Click on the desired property.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click the **[!UICONTROL Configure]** button under the Adobe Analytics extension.
1. Expand the [!UICONTROL Configure tracking using custom code] accordion, which reveals the [!UICONTROL Open Editor] button.
1. Open the custom code editor and paste the plug-in code provided below into the edit window.
1. Save and publish the changes to the Analytics extension.

## Install the plug-in using AppMeasurement

Copy and paste the following code anywhere in the AppMeasurement file after the Analytics tracking object is instantiated (using [`s_gi`](../functions/s-gi.md)). Preserving comments and version numbers of the code in your implementation helps Adobe with troubleshooting any potential issues.

```js
/******************************************* BEGIN CODE TO DEPLOY *******************************************/
/* Adobe Consulting Plugin: cleanStr v2.0 (No Prerequisites Required) */
function cleanStr(str){var a=str;if("-v"===a)return{plugin:"cleanStr",version:"2.0"};a:{if("undefined"!==typeof window.s_c_il){var b=0;for(var c;b<window.s_c_il.length;b++)if(c=window.s_c_il[b],c._c&&"s_c"===c._c){b=c;break a}}b=void 0}"undefined"!==typeof b&&(b.contextData.cleanStr="2.0");if("string"===typeof a){a=a.replace(/<\/?[^>]+(>|$)/g,"");a=a.trim();a=a.replace(/[\u2018\u2019\u201A]/g,"'");a=a.replace(/\t+/g,"");for(a=a.replace(/[\n\r]/g," ");-1<a.indexOf("  ");)a=a.replace(/\s\s/g," ");return a}return""}
/******************************************** END CODE TO DEPLOY ********************************************/
```

## Use the plug-in

The `cleanStr` function uses the following arguments:

* **`str`** (required, string): The value that you want to clean HTML encoding, extra whitespace, tabs, or other unnecessary characters.

The function returns the value of the `str` argument with all unnecessary characters removed.

## Examples

```js
// Returns the value "this is a messystring". Note that both tabs and extra spaces are present in the original string.
// Multiple spaces are reduced to one, while tabs are omitted entirely.
s.eVar1 = "  this  is a      messy  string    ";
s.eVar1 = cleanStr(s.eVar1)

// This function call does not do anything because the code does not assign the returned value to a variable.
s.eVar1 = "  this  is a      messy  string    ";
cleanStr(s.eVar1);
```
