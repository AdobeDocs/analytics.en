# Data Sources Manager

Create, manage, and view the use of data sources in a report suite.

 **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Data Sources]**.

## Create Tab {#section_74603FDA3D8842E49F1A51624A06DE20}

The [!UICONTROL Create] tab lets you configure a new data source for the currently selected report suite. When you activate a data source, the [!UICONTROL Data Sources Wizard] guides you through the process of creating a Data Sources template, and creates an FTP location for uploading data.

The selection you make on the Create tab determines the initial fields in the template that is created. See [Generating an Import File Template](/help/import/c-data-sources/datasrc-template/t-datasrc-creating-data-sources-file.md).
