# Segments manager

The Segment Manager offers many ways of curating segments, such as sharing, filtering, tagging, approving, copying, deleting, and marking as favorites.

The Analytics Segment Manager shows you all the segments you own and that have been shared with you. Admin-level users can see all segments in the organization. This overview presents the user interface and the capabilities of the Segment Manager.

   The following columns are available:

   | Column title | Description  |

   | Title and description | These values are provided in the Segment builder. To edit the title and description, select the title link to open the Segment builder.  |
   | Favorites  | Displays star icons next to each segment, allowing you to mark segments as favorites. For more information, see [Mark segments as favorites](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/t-seg-favorite.md). |
   | Report suites  | This column indicates in which report suite the segment was last saved.  |
   | Owner  | Indicates who owns the segment. As a non-Admin, you can see only segments you own or those that were shared with you.  |
