# Targets

Targets let you measure your website performance and track progress against target goals. For example, you might want to increase the number of visitors that come from a geographic region, the revenue per order, or the number of hits that come from a specific referrer.

## Targets {#concept_6516E81923E845198B7FC5D8F81DC35C}

Targets let you measure your website performance and track progress against target goals. For example, you might want to increase the number of visitors that come from a geographic region, the revenue per order, or the number of hits that come from a specific referrer. 

When you create targets, you select which attribute metrics or eVars you want to measure or you can choose to measure your entire site against your selected metric.

For example, you can measure the number of unique visitors to your website, and use it as a target. In this case, choose the entire website. However, if you want to target the number of unique visitors to your website from Chicago, you can specify that eVar rather than look at your entire site.

   <td colname="col1"> Target Name </td> 
   <td colname="col2">Provide a target name, which is displayed on the <span class="wintitle"> Target Manager</span> page. </td>

  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> Apply To </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> Lets you apply the target to the entire site or to a selected attribute or eVar. </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> Select Item </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Displays the selection form for the selected attribute or eVar, so that you can perform an Advanced search for related items. For example, if you select the eVar <span class="uicontrol"> Countries</span>, the item list lets you specify which country. If you select the eVar <span class="uicontrol"> Products</span>, the item list lets you specify which product. Custom insight variables are also listed in the menu. If you have a custom insight variable set up to measure visitor age ranges, then the item list displays the ranges of the ages, such as 18-24, 25-35, and so on. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> Metric </td> 
   <td colname="col2">Lets you apply the target to a metric. This menu displays only those metrics that apply to a given eVar. For example, if you select <span class="uicontrol"> Products</span> as the eVar, a metric such as <span class="uicontrol"> Page Exits</span> does not apply to it. The <span class="uicontrol"> Page Exits</span> metric can apply to a web page eVar. </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> Period </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Lets you define the <span class="uicontrol"> Date Range</span> and <span class="uicontrol"> Granularity</span> settings of the target. Depending on your date range specifications, some granularity options do not apply. When typing values for your metrics, type a value for each granularity setting. For example, if your date range is the month of February, and your granularity selection is weekly, type a value for each week of the month of February. Target reports display for each granularity setting. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> Values </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Lets you specify target values for the time period and the selected metric. This value are the target numbers that you are attempting to reach. For example, if the target were based on revenue, and you were aiming for $10,000 of revenue for a given month, you would enter 10000 in the value field for the month. </p> </td>
