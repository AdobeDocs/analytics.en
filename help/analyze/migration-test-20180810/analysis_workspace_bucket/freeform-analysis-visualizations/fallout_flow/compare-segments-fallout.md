# Apply segments in fallout analysis


## Create a segment from a touchpoint {#section_915E8FBF35CD4F34828F860C1CCC2272}


1. First, create a segment from a specific touchpoint that you are especially interested in and that might be useful to apply to other reports. You do this by right-clicking the touchpoint and selecting ** [!UICONTROL  Create segment from touchpoint] **. ![](graphics/segment-from-touchpoint.png) 

   The Segment Builder opens, pre-populated with the pre-built sequential segment that matches the touchpoint you selected:

1. Give the segment a title and description and save it. You can now use this segment in any report you wish. 


## Add a segment as a touchpoint {#section_17611C1A07444BE891DC21EE8FC03EFC}

If you want to see, for example, how your US users trend and affect the fallout, just drag the US users segment into the fallout:

Or you can create an AND touchpoint by dragging the US users segment onto another checkpoint. 

## Compare segments in fallout {#section_E0B761A69B1545908B52E05379277B56}

You can compare an unlimited number of segments in the Fallout visualization. 

1. Select the segments you want to compare from the [!UICONTROL  Segments] rail on the left. In our example, we have selected 2 segments: US Users and Non-US Users.
1. Drag them into the Segment drop zone at the top. ![](graphics/segment-drop.png) 

1. Optional: You can keep "All Visits" as the default container or delete it. ![](graphics/seg-compare.png) 

1. You can now compare the fallout across the two segments, such as where one segment is outperforming another, or other insights.
