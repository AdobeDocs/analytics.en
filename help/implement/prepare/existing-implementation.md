# Take charge of an existing Adobe Analytics implementation

Are you taking over an Adobe Analytics implementation from the previous Technical Owner? Our Inherited Implementation Playbook will help you take charge as the new Technical Owner of an existing implementation. In the downloadable spreadsheet, we'll walk you though the discovery, audit, and documentation activities you should do in your first 10 weeks on the job as you take over an existing implementation.
