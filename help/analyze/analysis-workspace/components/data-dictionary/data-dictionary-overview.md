# Data Dictionary overview

The Data Dictionary in Analysis Workspace helps both users and administrators keep track of and better understand the components in their Analytics environment.   

Analytics administrators are responsible for curating information about each component in the Data Dictionary to make it available to users.

## Benefits for users

The Data Dictionary helps users gain a better understanding of each component that is available to them. 

Information available in the Data Dictionary includes: 

* A component's function and intended use

* Components typically used with the one you are viewing

* Components that are similar to the one you are viewing

* Whether a component is approved by the system administrator 

For information about how to access the Data Dictionary and for details about the information it contains, see [View component information in the Data Dictionary](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/data-dictionary/view-data-dictionary.md).

## Benefits for administrators

The Data Dictionary helps system administrators keep track of and curate the components in their Analytics environment. 

Following are some of the ways Analytics administrators can use the Data Dictionary: 

* Identify duplicate components that need to be consolidated.

* Identify components that aren't collecting any data so they can be either updated or deleted.

* Identify components that are not yet approved.

* Update component descriptions directly in Analysis Workspace. Any updates made to component descriptions in the Data Dictionary are reflected in the Report Suite.

  Similarly, any updates made to component descriptions in the Report Suite are reflected in Analysis Workspace.

  For more information about adding component descriptions in either Analysis Workspace or in a Report Suite, see [Add component descriptions](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/add-component-descriptions.md).

## Access the Data Dictionary

You can access the Data Dictionary in any of the following ways within Analysis Workspace:

* From the **Data Dictionary** icon in the left rail.

For detailed information about the various options available in the Data Dictionary, see [View component information in the Data Dictionary](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/data-dictionary/view-data-dictionary.md).

## Update and curate the Data Dictionary

Analytics administrators are responsible for maintaining a healthy Data Dictionary for their organization, as described in [Monitor Data Dictionary Health](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/data-dictionary/monitor-data-dictionary-health.md).

As part of this process, Analytics administrators can edit information about each component in the data dictionary, as described in [Edit component entries in the Data Dictionary](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/data-dictionary/edit-entries-data-dictionary.md).

## Move, minimize, or close the Data Dictionary

When you open the Data Dictionary (as described in [Access the Data Dictionary](#access-the-data-dictionary)), it displays as a window on top of Analysis Workspace. 

You can manipulate the Data Dictionary window in any of the following ways:

* Drag it to any area within Analysis Workspace 

  If you close and re-open Analysis Workspace, the Data Dictionary window remains in the location where you last moved it. <!--True?-->

* Minimize it

  When minimized, the Data Dictionary appears as a blue tab in the lower-right corner of Analysis Workspace.

  When you select the blue tab, the Data Dictionary opens to the component you were most recently viewing. 

* Close it
