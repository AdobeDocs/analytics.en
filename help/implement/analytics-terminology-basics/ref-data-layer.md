# Data Layer

A "data layer" is a framework of JavaScript objects that developers insert into pages. The data layers can be used by tracking tools (including tag management systems like Dynamic Tag Management) to populate reports.

Implementing a data layer on your site provides ultimate control and flexibility over your implementation and allows easiest maintenance in future phasesâ€‹. The names of these JavaScript objects are theoretically arbitrary, but the best practice is to use something consistent and predictable. The developers may already have a data layer, or a preference for the format. There are few different standards the tracking community has created as a starting point. The [Data Layer for Analytics Implementation](files/Datalayer Documentation.docx) specification document uses the W3C standard "digitalData" object that is accepted by the widest variety of tracking technology, in case there is a need to use the data layer for more than this DTM implementation.
