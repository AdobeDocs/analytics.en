# Configuration within Selligent{#configuration-within-selligent}

As soon as the Integration is enabled inside Adobe Analytics, an automatic configuration is enabled on the Selligent side.

A tracker has been created which will track every e-mail. In case you want to limit it to a certain domain, please update the tracker configuration.

We highly recommended that you move the tracking parameter for Adobe Analytics in the URL to the front. This will ensure that the Adobe Processing rules pick up the parameters from the landing page URL. Enable the tracking by checking the checkbox as shown below.
