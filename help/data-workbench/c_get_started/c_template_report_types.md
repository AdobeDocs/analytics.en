# Using the Analytics report templates

Standard report templates (for the Adobe SC profile) provide pre-configured Adobe Analytics reports designed for immediate use.

For Adobe Analytics' users, these templates allow users employing the Adobe SC profile to view reports generated from Data Workbench using templates similar to the Adobe [Marketing Reports & Analytics](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/digital-analytics/marketing-reports-analytics.html?promoid=KAUCM) (formerly SiteCatalyst) capability.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This menu will only appear for those users who have implemented the Adobe SC profile.

**To Open Reports**

On the worktop, right-click and select **[!UICONTROL New]** to view and open report templates.

The following is a list of Analytic reports: 

|  Reports  | Description  |
|---|---|
| [Page Views](http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/reports_page_views.html)  | A trended report that displays the number of times your website pages were viewed for the selected time period (hour, day, week, month, quarter, or year). This report allows you to track page views for each page on your site, as well as an aggregate of page views for your entire site.  |
| [Key Metrics](http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/reports_key_metrics.html)  | The Key Metrics Report lets you compare metrics to see whether they trend together. For example, as your page views increase, does your visitor count increase?  |
| [Unique Visitors](http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/reports_unique_visitors_v15_dsc.html)  | Shows you the number of unique visitors who accessed your site. Each visitor is counted once, regardless of how many times the person visits your website.  |
| [Pages](http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/reports_pages.html)  | Ranks the pages on your site based on the pages that receive the most traffic. If your business question deals with quantitative data for pages, you can use this report to answer that question, by adding the right metrics.  |
| [Traffic](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/index.html?f=reports_traffic)  | Traffic reports give you in-depth insight into how visitors interact with your website.  |
| [Conversion](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/index.html?f=reports_conversion)  | Provide comprehensive, accurate, and detailed analysis of customer activity. Metrics such as campaign management, sales cycle, customer fallout, and customer conversion let you measure e-commerce transactions, sources of sales, advertising effectiveness, customer loyalty, and more.  |
| [Campaign](http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/reports_campaigns.html)  | Displays information about the effectiveness of your advertising efforts. You can see which types advertising efforts give you the most traffic and which of your employees is responsible for driving those efforts.  |
| [Product](http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/reports_products.html)  | Identifies how individual products and groups of products (categories) contribute to your various conversion metrics, such as Revenue or Checkouts.  |
| [Referring Domain](http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/reports_referring_domains.html)  | Shows the domains that referred the customers that most impacted your site's success metrics. Referrers fall into two main categories: Domains and URLs. Domains refer to the domain name, and appear as the base domain without the query string or subdirectories attached. URLs include the base domain name, as well as any query strings or subdirectories.  |
| [Search Keyword](http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/reports_search_keywords.html)  | Reports that display a breakdown of search keywords.  |
