# Path Length

Displays, by percentage and by total count, the depth of each visit to your site. In other words, the report indicates how many pages the average visitor to your site views before leaving.

Custom links (s.tl calls) do not add to the path length for pages. However, they do count in path length for props (traffic variables.)

Multiple instances of the same value (reloads) do not increase path length. Examples:

**[!UICONTROL Page A]** > **[!UICONTROL Page B]** > **[!UICONTROL Custom link]** > **[!UICONTROL Page B]** = Path length of 2. (Notice that the custom link and the reload of page B do not count toward the path length.)

**[!UICONTROL Prop A]** > **[!UICONTROL Custom Link pass Prop B]** > **[!UICONTROL Prop C]** = Path length of 3. (Notice that the custom link for Prop B does count toward the path length.)
