# End-of-life for Adobe Data Connectors

For more than a decade, Adobe Analytics has aimed to provide the best-in-class web & marketing analytics solution to meet customers' needs. As technology and business needs evolve, we strive to continually deliver and meet the highest standards.  Unfortunately, the APIs that power this integration no longer meet those standards and are not tenable in modern Adobe Analytics technology infrastructure.

**Effective August 1, 2021**, Adobe intends to discontinue Data Connectors Integrations. End-of-life is part of any technology product's lifecycle and Adobe aims to make the transition as seamless as possible for our customers and partners. Many of these integrations are available via Adobe Exchange and can continue to be utilized.  

## Why are we end-of-lifing this feature?

This feature is powered by legacy technology that is no longer viable or supported. We have a new standard in the [Adobe Exchange Partner Program](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud) that should be adopted for any integrations that wish to continue to be offered and supported. 

## How does removal of this feature impact you?

If you are an Adobe Partner, details on migrating your integration to our new Adobe Exchange program can found [here](https://adobeexchangeec.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003867071-Adobe-Analytics-Integration-Tools) in our documentation.  

If you are a Data Connector customer and want to request that the integration you use should be migrated, you should *route all requests directly to the Integration Partner*. Sending a request to Adobe via Customer Care will not have the same desired effect.

Each company providing an integration was given the option to migrate their integration to Adobe Exchange or discontinue their integration. Below is a summary of each current integration and their accompanying decision.

For additional questions or support, please reach out to Adobe Customer Care.

## Exception: Adobe Campaign Classic

The ONE exception to the August 1, 2021 date is the Adobe Campaign Classic integration. This integration will officially be deprecated on March 1, 2022. 

On August 1, 2021, Adobe Campaign Classic will be removed from the Data Connectors UI along with all other integrations; however, existing Campaign integrations will continue to collect and pass data to Adobe Analytics until March 1, 2022. On March 1, 2022, the integration will cease to collect and pass data to Adobe Analytics. Adobe Campaign is building a new integration on Adobe Exchange to replace the current Data Connectors Integration. Adobe Campaign anticipates finishing this new integration in time to give customers to migrate to the new integration before the deprecation date in March 2022.
