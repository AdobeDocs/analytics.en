# Add component descriptions

Descriptions help users know how to best use the various components when building projects in Analysis Workspace or when viewing reports. 

Analytics administrators can add descriptions for components (Dimensions, Metrics, Segments, and Date Ranges) either within the Report Suite or using the Data Dictionary directly within Analysis Workspace.

## Add descriptions to components in Analysis Workspace (using the Data Dictionary) {#add-descriptions}

The Data Dictionary in Analysis Workspace helps both users and administrators keep track of and better understand the components in their Analytics environment. This includes the ability for Analytics administrators to add component descriptions directly within Analysis Workspace. 

For information about adding a component description in the data dictionary, see [Edit component entries in the Data Dictionary](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/data-dictionary/edit-entries-data-dictionary.md).

For general information about the Data Dictionary, see [Data Dictionary overview](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/data-dictionary/data-dictionary-overview.md).
