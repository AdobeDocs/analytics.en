# Referrers

Displays the domain or URL where your visitors came from before they arrived at your site, the methods visitors use to find your website, and the number of visits to your site that came from these referring locations.

For example, if a visitor clicks a link from Site A and arrives at your site, Site A is the referrer if it is not defined as part of your domain. During implementation, your implementation consultant can help you to define the domains and URLs that are part of your website. (This change can be done after implementation.)

Domains or URLs that are not part of those defined domains and URLs are considered referrers. For example, web page A and web page B are added to the internal URL filter, but web page C is not. In this case, web page C is considered a referrer.

## Notes {#section_B83A3571D64E4E7792712FAF740D7955}

* The referrer, referrer type, and referring domain are set on the first hit of the visit, or during a visit when the referrer is external (for example, if a visitor leaves your site, uses a search engine, then returns to your site before the first visit expires). These values are set at the same time and persist across the visit.
* Internal URLs are filtered. Only referrers that do not match the internal URL filters are in this report.
* The corresponding metric is called Referrer Instance in ad hoc analysis.
* Typed/Bookmarked values are not included on Referrers Report. This means that site wide Visits don't match visits on this report.
