# Upload a workbook

Upload a Report Builder Excel workbook that you want to share.

The [!UICONTROL Workbook Library] lets you upload a Report Builder Excel workbook that you want to share. You can also download and edit shared workbooks. When migrating from ExcelClient to Report Builder, it is recommended that you download workbooks from the ExcelClient repository and then upload them to the Report Builder repository.

> [!NOTE] Only workbooks with Report Builder requests can be uploaded. Also, you can distribute Report Builder reports to people who do not use Report Builder. (Users are not required to log in to see the data.)

1. Create and run a request.
1. After you have saved the report, click **[!UICONTROL Share]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Browse]** to locate the workbook.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Description]** field, type a description, then click **[!UICONTROL Upload]**.
