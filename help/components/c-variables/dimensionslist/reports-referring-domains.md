## Notes {#section_B83A3571D64E4E7792712FAF740D7955}

* The referrer, referrer type, and referring domain are set on the first hit of the visit, or during a visit when the referrer is external (for example, if a visitor leaves your site, uses a search engine, then returns to your site before the first visit expires). These values are set at the same time and persist across the visit.
* The Typed/bookmarked line item does not include other referrer types such as no Javascript or inside your site. Therefore the line items won't match the total because of these omissions.
* Before July 2012, mobile traffic did not appear in this report.
