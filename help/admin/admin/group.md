# Group Management

A group is a collection of users that you want to give a common set of access and permissions. For example, if you have 50 marketing report users, but only 20 need access to ad hoc analysis, you can create a group for those 20 users.

 See [Groups](/help/admin/user-management2/c-user-groups/groups.md) for configuration information.
