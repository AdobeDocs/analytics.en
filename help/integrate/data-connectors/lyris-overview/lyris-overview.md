# Lyris Data Connector for Adobe Analytics{#lyris-data-connector-for-adobe-analytics}

Describes the marketing efficiencies achieved through the integration.

The Adobe® Data Connectors™ email integration combines behavioral information from Adobe Analytics with Lyris email marketing to redefine success measurement and target audiences with more relevant messaging.

Delivering relevant email messages to these market segments can result in entirely new revenue opportunities, driving increased conversion and revenue among new and existing email campaigns. For example, delivering relevant email messages based on products that were viewed during a visit or products that were left in an abandoned shopping cart has been proven to have dramatic impact on revenue, with minimal impact on cost because this is simply leveraging visitors your site is already getting.

This increase in marketing efficiency is one of the key benefits of integrating Adobe Analytics with Lyris. Additionally, this integration will automatically synchronize email metrics with Adobe Analytics data as frequently as hourly for closed-loop reporting.
