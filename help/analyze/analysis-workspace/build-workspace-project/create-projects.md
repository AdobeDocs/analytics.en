# Create projects

[Projects](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md) in Analysis Workspace allow you to surface business-critical data that can be shared with stakeholders inside or outside your organization. 

For general information about how to get started using Analysis Workspace, see [Analysis Workspace overview](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.md).

The following sections describe how to create a project and start adding the key building blocks for any Analysis Workspace project: panels, visualizations, and components.

## Create a project from a blank project or a template

1. In Adobe Analytics, select [!UICONTROL **Workspace**].

1. Choose whether to create a blank project or to create a project from a template:

   +++Create a blank project

   1. Select the [!UICONTROL **Projects**] tab, then select [!UICONTROL **Create project**].

   1. Choose whether to create a blank project or a blank mobile scorecard

      * **Blank project** if you plan to share your analysis from the browser 
      * [!UICONTROL **Blank mobile scorecard**](/help/analyze/mobile-app/curator.md) if you plan to share your analysis from the Adobe Analytics dashboards mobile app.

   1. Select [!UICONTROL **Create**].

   +++

   +++Create a project from a template
   
      1. Select the [!UICONTROL **Reports**] tab.

      1. Search for or navigate to the template you want to use, then select it when it appears.

          A set of standard templates are available by default. In addition, your organization might have created custom templates for you to choose from.

          For more information, see [Get started with Reports & Analytics](/help/analyze/reports-analytics/getting-started.md).

1. Next, you need to add panels, visualizations, and components to your project. First, add panels to your project in Analysis Workspace, as described in [Add panels to the project](#add-panels-to-the-project). You can then add visualizations to any panels. Finally, you can add components to any panels or visualizations.

## Add panels to the project {#panels}

[Panels](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/panels/panels.html) are the foundation to any project in Analysis Workspace. They are used to organize the content (visualizations and components) of a project. Before you can add components or visualizations to a project, you need to add panels. 

Many of the panels provided in Analysis Workspace generate a full set of analyses based on a few user inputs. 

To add a panel:

1. Select the [!UICONTROL **Panels**] icon in the left rail.

   ![](assets/build-panels.png)

1. Search for the panel you want to add. When it appears in the left rail, drag it into your project.

1. Add visualizations to your panel, as described in [Add visualizations to the project](#add-visualizations-to-the-project). 

   Alternatively, you can add components directly to a panel, as described in [Add components to the project](#add-components-to-the-project).

## Add visualizations to the project

[Visualizations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-analysis-visualizations.html) (such as a freeform table, a bar chart, or a line chart) can be used to visually bring data to life. 

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Visualizations]** icon in the left rail.

   ![](assets/build-visualizations.png)

1. Search for the visualization you want to add. When it appears in the left rail, drag it to a panel within your project. 

1. Add components to the visualization, as described in [Add components to the project](#add-components-to-the-project).

## Add components to the project

[Components](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/analysis-workspace-components.md) make up the actual data of any project. You can add components to visualizations or to panels.

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Components]** icon in the left rail.

   ![](assets/build-components.png)

1. Search for the component you want to add. When it appears in the left rail, drag it to a panel or visualization within your project. 

>[!TIP]
>
>   For information about each components, select the Info icon next to a component's name in the left rail, or see the [Analytics Components Guide](/help/components/home.md).
