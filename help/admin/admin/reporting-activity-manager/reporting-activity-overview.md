# Reporting Activity Manager overview

The [!UICONTROL Reporting Activity Manager] is available for administrators. 

If your organization experiences a degradation in reporting performance during peak reporting times, the Reporting Activity Manager enables you to self-diagnose and fix capacity issues without intervention from Adobe Customer Care. You can easily manage reporting queues within a single interface and immediately act​​ to improve your users' experience. 

## Benefits

Reporting Activity Manager provides the following benefits:

* Lets you monitor and manage reporting capacity for each report suite in your organization.
* Informs you in real time about your current reporting capacity across your report suites.
* Provides detailed report information on current reporting requests, whether queued or in progress.
* Lets you optimize the reporting queue by prioritizing some and canceling other reporting requests to free up capacity. It answers questions like: is this report necessary at this time or can I cancel it in favor of more urgent reports?
* Lets you restrict future requests for a specified time period. You can restrict specific requests, or you can restrict all requests from a specific user or requests that are associated with a specific project.
