# Adobe plug-in: getPageLoadTime

>[!IMPORTANT] This plug-in is provided by Adobe Consulting as a courtesy to help you get more value out of Adobe Analytics. Adobe Customer Care does not provide support with this plug-in, including installation or troubleshooting. If you require help with this plug-in, contact your organization's Account Manager. They can arrange a meeting with a consultant for assistance.

The `getPageLoadTime` plug-in uses the JavaScript performance object to allow you to measure the amount of time a page takes to completely load. Adobe recommends using this plug-in if you want to measure how long pages take to load.

## Install the plug-in using the Adobe Experience Platform Launch extension

Adobe offers an extension that allows you to use most commonly-used plug-ins.

1. Log in to [launch.adobe.com](https://launch.adobe.com) using your AdobeID credentials.
1. Click the desired property.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click on the [!UICONTROL Catalog] button
1. Install and publish the [!UICONTROL Common Analytics Plugins] extension
1. If you haven't already, create a rule labeled "Initialize Plug-ins" with the following configuration:
    * Condition: None
    * Event: Core – Library Loaded (Page Top)
1. Add an action to the above rule with the following configuration:
    * Extension: Common Analytics Plugins
    * Action Type: Initialize getPageLoadTime
1. Save and publish the changes to the rule.

## Install the plug-in using Launch custom code editor

If you do not want to use the plug-in extension, you can use the custom code editor.

1. Log in to [launch.adobe.com](https://launch.adobe.com) using your AdobeID credentials.
1. Click on the desired property.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click the [!UICONTROL Configure] button under the Adobe Analytics extension.
1. Expand the [!UICONTROL Configure tracking using custom code] accordion, which reveals the [!UICONTROL Open Editor] button.
1. Open the custom code editor and paste the plug-in code provided below into the edit window.
1. Save and publish the changes to the Analytics extension.

## Install the plug-in using AppMeasurement

Copy and paste the following code anywhere in the AppMeasurement file after the Analytics tracking object is instantiated (using [`s_gi`](../functions/s-gi.md)). Preserving comments and version numbers of the code in your implementation helps Adobe with troubleshooting any potential issues.

```js
/******************************************* BEGIN CODE TO DEPLOY *******************************************/
/* Adobe Consulting Plugin: getPageLoadTime v1.0 with performanceWriteFull, performanceWritePart, performanceCheck, and performanceRead helper functions (Requires p_fo plug-in) */
s.getPageLoadTime=function(){var a=this;if("undefined"!==typeof performance&&a.p_fo("performance")){var b=performance; b.clearResourceTimings();""!==a.c_r("s_plt")&&(0<b.timing.loadEventEnd&&clearInterval(a.pi),a._pltLoadTime=a.c_r("s_plt"),a._pltPreviousPage=a.c_r("s_pltp"),a.c_w("s_plt",""),a.c_w("s_pltp",""));0===b.timing.loadEventEnd?a.pi=setInterval(function(){a.performanceWriteFull()},250):0<b.timing.loadEventEnd&&(a.ptc?a.ptc===b.timing.loadEventEnd&&1===b.getEntries().length&&(a.pwp=setInterval(function(){a.performanceWritePart()},500)):a.performanceWriteFull())}};
s.performanceWriteFull=function(){var s=this,a=performance.timing;0<a.loadEventEnd&&(clearInterval(s.pi),""===s.c_r("s_plt")&& (s.c_w("s_plt",s.performanceCheck(a.loadEventEnd,a.navigationStart)),s.c_w("s_pltp",s.pageName)));s.ptc=a.loadEventEnd};
s.performanceWritePart=function(){var s=this,a=performance;0<a.getEntries().length&&(s.ppfe===a.getEntries().length? clearInterval(s.pwp):s.ppfe=a.getEntries().length);""===s.c_r("s_plt")&&(s.c_w("s_plt",((a.getEntries()[a.getEntries().length-1].responseEnd-a.getEntries()[0].startTime)/1E3).toFixed(2)),s.c_w("s_pltp",s.pageName))};
s.performanceCheck=function(a,b){if(0<=a&&0<=b)return 6E4>a-b&&0<=a-b?parseFloat((a-b)/1E3).toFixed(2):60};

/* Adobe Consulting Plugin: p_fo (pageFirstOnly) v2.0 */
s.p_fo=function(on){var s=this;s.__fo||(s.__fo={});if(s.__fo[on])return!1;s.__fo[on]={};return!0};
/******************************************** END CODE TO DEPLOY ********************************************/

## Use the plug-in

The `getPageLoadTime` method does not use any arguments. When calling this method, it does not return anything. Instead, it sets the following variables:

* `s._pltPreviousPage`: The previous page so you can correlate load time to the previous page
* `s._pltLoadTime`: The time in seconds that the previous page took to load

The getPageLoadTime plug-in creates two first-party cookies:

* `s_plt`: The time, in seconds, that the previous page took to load. Expires at the end of the browser session.
* `s_pltp` The value of the `s.pageName` variable as recorded in the previous Adobe Analytics image request. Expires at the end of the browser session.

## Example Calls

### Example #1

Running the following code...

```js
if(s.pageName) s.getPageLoadTime();
if(s._pltPreviousPage)
{
  s.prop10 = s._pltLoadTime;
  s.prop11 = s._pltPreviousPage
  s.eVar10 = prop11;
  s.events = "event100=" + s._pltLoadTime;
}
```

...will do the following:

* Run the getPageLoadTime plug-in when s.pageName is set
* Set s.prop10 equal to the load time of the previous page
* Set s.prop11 and s.eVar10 equal to the name of the previous page (as recorded in s.pageName)
* Set event100, which would be a custom numeric event, equal to the load time of the previous page.   Using a custom event in this case would allow you to get the total amount of time for all page loads of the previous page (from all visitors/visits) and thus use a calculated metric to get the average page load time for each page
