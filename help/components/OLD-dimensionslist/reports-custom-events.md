# Custom Events

The conversion actions on your site that you want visitors to complete. These actions might be a registration, a subscription, a lead form completion, a chat initiation, a purchase, a booking, or a finished survey.

Because each report suite differs, this set of reports is used differently for each client. A Custom Event report can be used as a counter that shows the number of times an event occurs. For example, if **[!UICONTROL event1]** is set to count the number of times a document is downloaded, then the Custom Event report for Event 1 shows the total number of times the event (or download) occurs. You can have multiple custom event reports.
