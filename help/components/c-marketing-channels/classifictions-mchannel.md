# Classifications in Marketing Channels

>[!NOTE]
>
>To maximize effectiveness of Marketing Channels for Attribution IQ and Customer Journey Analytics, we have published some [revised best practices](/help/components/c-marketing-channels/mchannel-best-practices.md).

Use classifications to categorize values into related groups and to report at the group level. For example, you can classify all Paid Search campaigns into a category like Video Cards. Then you can report on the success of that category relative to metrics like Instances (or click-throughs).

Classifications that you add in this procedure display in the [!UICONTROL Marketing Channel Overview] report as [!UICONTROL Channel Values]. Channel Values are unclassified values in the channel detail.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Ensure that you are familiar with creating classifications in [Classifications](/help/components/classifications/c-classifications.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The Marketing Channels classification reports behave a little differently than standard classifications: when you create classifications for either first touch or last touch reports, they are automatically applied to both. You cannot classify one without classifying the other.
