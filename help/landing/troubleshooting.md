## Integrating with Experience Cloud Solutions

### Integrating Target into Analytics (A4T)

Adobe "Analytics for Target" (A4T) is a cross-solution integration that lets you create activities based on Analytics conversion metrics and audience segments. This integration lets you use Analytics reports to examine your results.

If you use Analytics as the reporting source for an activity, all reporting and segmentation for that activity is based on Analytics data collection. [Learn how to use A4T](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/a4t/a4t.html). 

### Integrating Analytics into AAM

Server-side forwarding is designed for customers who use Analytics and Audience Manager. Server-side forwarding lets you remove DIL (Audience Manager's data collection code) and replace it with the Audience Management Module.

When added to your AppMeasurement code, this module lets your Analytics implementation collect and send data to Audience Manager via server-side data transfers. [Learn more about server-side forwarding](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/ssf.html).

### Integrating AMO into Analytics

If you’ve chosen Adobe Analytics, and either have Adobe Media Optimizer (AMO) or are considering it, there are significant benefits to using the two together, but you might not realize just how powerful these two solutions combined can be. [Learn more about the Analytics & AMO integration](https://helpx.adobe.com/media-optimizer/kb/adobe-analytics-media-optimizer-integration-AMO-adobeanaytics-integrating.html)

### Integrating Analytics & AEM (via DTM)

Integrate Adobe Dynamic Tag Management with AEM so that you can use your Dynamic Tag Management web properties to track AEM sites. [Learn more aboutintegrating Analytics & AEM via DTM](https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-2/administer/integration/marketing-cloud/dtm.html)

### Integrating Analytics & Campaign

Integration between the Marketing Cloud Activation core service Triggers and Adobe Campaign allows you to send personalized emails to your customers as a reaction to specific behaviors that are tracked on your website by Adobe Analytics (within 15 minutes). [Learn more about Marketing Cloud triggers and Campaign](https://docs.campaign.adobe.com/doc/standard/en/EMA_Transactional_messaging_Marketing_Cloud_Triggers.html)

### Marketing Cloud Customer Attributes

If you capture enterprise customer data in a customer relationship management (CRM) database, you can upload the data into a customer attribute data source in the Marketing Cloud. Once uploaded, data can be leverages in Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target. [Learn more about Marketing Cloud Customer Attributes](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/attributes.html)

### Sharing Analytics segments to the Marketing Cloud

Analytics segments can be published to the Marketing Cloud and used in Adobe Target, for audience marketing activities. [Learn more about publishing Analytics segments to the Marketing Cloud](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/t_publish_audience_segment.html)
