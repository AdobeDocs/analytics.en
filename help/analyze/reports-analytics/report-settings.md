<!--Meike, I replaced this table with one from https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/user/report_settings.html -bob -->

|Element|Description|
|--- |--- |
|**General Settings**||
|Include related metrics section|Related metrics are closely related to the report you are currently viewing (for example, the top five pages in the page views report).|
|Show internet average in details section|Expresses the average value for a given statistic, taken across several thousand business websites. When enabled, this section appears as a separate column in the report summary and report details sections. This feature is used only by the traffic reports in the technology group, as well as the search engines, languages, and domains reports.|
|Show Adobe's default menu structure|Ignores the settings in the Admin Tools, where administrators customize report menus to fit user preferences, returning the report menu to default settings.|
|Force column widths when displaying reports|Forces report column widths to an aesthetically pleasing consistency. This setting is useful when more than three metrics are displayed.|
|**Graphs and Charts**||
|Highlight weekends on trending graphs|Vertically highlights the weekend dates of trended report graphs. Trended reports can be much easier to evaluate when the weekends are identified.|
|Include forecast in graph and summary|Estimates how much a particular statistic will occur in the future. The forecast appears in the report summary section when enabled.|
|Include Calendar Events in Reports|Tracks site performance relative to specific events. When enabled, these events appear on your reports.|
|Use Flash graphs|Enables Flash graphs in your reports. Flash graphs provide sharper, more interactive images for reports, but do not allow you to easily copy or save the images. For quick image copying or saving functionality, disable this option (images will be in .gif format). If you deselect this option, the copy graph button does not appear in the report toolbar.|
|Show "All Others" data in selected graphs|Displays all others below the top five grouped in a single object. (Bar charts show the top five web pages or other data within your report.)|
|Show "None", "Unspecified" and "Typed/Bookmarked" data in report graphs|Shows metrics where no value received credit for the metric specified.|
|Show sparklines on ranked reports|Displays a sparkline in the totals field of ranked reports. This provides a quick view of the overall trend without generating a separate report.|
|**Acceleration**||
|Enable Report Accelerator to view reports more quickly|Enables the report accelerator, which uses a time- based algorithm to cache recently requested reports and examines only the mostfrequently occurring unique items, resulting in even faster delivery of reports. By caching requested reports for 15 minutes, the report accelerator can retrieve those reports for subsequent requests almost instantaneously. This setting is helpful when browsing back and forth, printing reports, or for frequent access to the same reports. When disabled, the system regenerates reports each time they are requested.|
|Enable Dashboard Accelerator and display available cached versions|Enables the dashboard accelerator, which stores a cached version of your dashboard for subsequent viewing. By caching a view of your dashboard for 24 hours, the dashboard accelerator is able to retrieve that view almost instantaneously because the intensive database querying and processing is done ahead of time. If the available cached version is more than 24 hours old, a new dashboard is generated and a new, cached version created. Likewise, a new, cached version is created whenever you update the dashboard (or any reportlet displayed on the dashboard). The cache is user-based. Other users viewing a shared dashboard see a version based on their own use of dashboard accelerator and updating of the dashboard.|
|Enable network acceleration for improved report performance|Speeds delivery of the data to your location by optimizing the path between the Adobe infrastructure and your environment.|
|Enable regional acceleration for a faster user experience in China|The Regional Accelerator uses region-specific accelerated domains, to provide a faster user experience within a specific region. Currently regional acceleration is only supported for China. Enabling this feature for users not located in China will result in slower user experience. After enabling regional acceleration, you must log in again for the setting to have an impact. If you wish to disable the Regional Accelerator, de-select this check box.|
|**Language/Currency/Encoding**||
|Thousands Separator| Select a separator for every thousands (decimal or comma). Many countries use a decimal to separate the thousands number. (This separator is applied to all numbers throughout the system, not just currency.)|
|Use the report suite's default currency|Specifies whether to use the report suite's default currency.|
|Currency|The currency to which you want to convert your data. When a value is selected in this setting, the data stored in the database is not affected, but is shown as a converted value based on the current day's currency conversion rate. When currency options are not configured (set to the defaults) no currency conversion takes place, and all values are stored and displayed in U.S. dollars (USD). To convert the currency when the data is processed (before it is displayed), contact your account manager.|
|Scheduled Report Encoding| SHIFT-JIS for Japanese character encoding. EUC-JP for extended Unix Code, primarily for Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese.|
|CSV Separator Character|The character you want to use to separate CSV values.|
