# Domain

The 'Domain' dimension reports which organizations or Internet service providers that visitors use to access the internet.

## Populate this dimension with data

This dimension uses information around the path that the image request took to reach Adobe data collection servers. It does not require any configuration, and does not have a variable to populate. It works out of the box with all AppMeasurement implementations.

## Dimension items

Example dimension items include `comcast.net`, `rr.com`, `sbcglobal.net`, and `amazonaws.com`. Note that these are domains that ISP's use to direct traffic, and not necessarily the domain representing the ISP organization.
