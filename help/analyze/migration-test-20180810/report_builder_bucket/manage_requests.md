# Manage requests

The [!UICONTROL  Request Manager] displays when you click ** [!UICONTROL  Manage] ** ( ![](Graphics/edit_request.gif)) in the report builder Toolbar. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Report Builder enforces request dependencies only within the same worksheet, not across worksheets. Restricting to dependencies within a single worksheet ensures timeliness of execution.
