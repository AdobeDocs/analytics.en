# Data Feed status

Feeds can be shown with any of several status labels.

|  Status  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Active  | The feed is operational.  |
|  Approval Pending  | In some circumstances, a feed might need to be approved by Adobe before it can start generating a job. In that case, this status is applied to the feed.  |
|  Deleted  | The feed has been deleted.  |
|  Complete  | The feed has run all its job. A completed feed can be edited, put on hold, and cancelled.  |
|  Pending  | The feed has been created but is not yet active. This is a short transitional state that might not appear in the Feeds list.  |
|  Inactive  | An inactive state is equivalent to a Paused or Hold state. Once the feed is reactivated, it will resume delivering the jobs from the moment it stopped.  |
