# Browser and FTP import

After you have copied the appropriate data into the classifications template file, you can import (upload) into Adobe data collection servers.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You do not need to download (using the export feature) your existing classification data before uploading new data. You only need to upload a new file containing the new rows of data. This method improves performance.

See [General File Structure](/help/components/classifications/importer/c-saint-data-files.md) for important information about the structure and limitations of uploaded files.

See [Common Classification Upload Issues](https://helpx.adobe.com/analytics/kb/common-saint-upload-issues.html) for troubleshooting help.
