description: Groups mobile devices based on the types of images they support. For example, if a visitor's phone that supports .jpg images, accesses a site, the Image Support report is incremented by at least one. If the phone supports more than one image format, then a visit to a site might result in multiple increments for that visit. In other words, if your phone supports .jpg, .png, and .gif formats, then each of those groups in the report is incremented. As such, the sum of the groups might be greater than the total shown at the bottom of the report.
