# Activate a color link

You can display the paths between nodes in a process map in color.

 The color scheme depends upon the color legend that is open in the workspace. See [Color Legends](../../c-analysis-vis/c-legends/c-color-leg.md#concept_F84D51DC0D6547F981D0642FC2D01358).

Right-click any node in the map and click **[!UICONTROL Options]** > **[!UICONTROL Color Links]**.

An X to the left of Color Links indicates that colored links are active in the map. When Color Links is disabled, arrows between nodes appear gray.
