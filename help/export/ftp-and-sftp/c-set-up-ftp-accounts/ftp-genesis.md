When you create an integration with an Adobe partner using [data connectors](https://www.adobeexchange.com/experiencecloud.html), Adobe can push re-marketing or other data to an FTP account, which you or the partner can download.

The expectation is that you manage the files on the FTP account to ensure that the integration has enough space on the FTP account to receive the data submitted to it by Adobe. This type of FTP account allows a maximum of 2 GB or 63 files.

For information on FTP limits and data retention, see [FTP Limits and Data Retention](/help/export/ftp-and-sftp/ftp-limits.md).
