# Metrics

Metrics are quantitative information about visitor activity, such as Views, Click-Throughs, Reloads, Average Time spent, Units, Orders, and Revenue.

Metrics are the foundation of reports and help you view and understand data relationships. They let you perform side-by-side comparisons of different data sets about your website.
