# Pie chart

The pie chart visualization displays elements as segments of a pie chart.

When you open a pie chart, the colors for data sets are set by default with each identified in the legend.

The legend can be toggled on and off by right-clicking the chart and selecting **Show Legend**. The result is a pie chart without color codes and elements identified in callouts for each section.
