# New report suite - settings

You can create a new report suite by selecting a pre-defined template, or by using one of your existing report suites to serve as a model.

Descriptions of the elements used when [creating a report suite](/help/admin/c-manage-report-suites/c-new-report-suite/t-create-a-report-suite.md).

> [!NOTE] The [Virtual Report Suite documentation](/help/components/vrs/c-workflow-vrs/vrs-create.md) shows you how to create virtual report suites.

You can remove extraneous filenames so that both these URLs show up as <span class="filepath"> https://mysite.com</span> in your reports. </p> <p>If you do not set this value, Analytics automatically removes the following filenames from URLs: <span class="filepath"> index.htm</span>, <span class="filepath"> index.html</span>, <span class="filepath"> index.cgi</span>, <span class="filepath"> index.asp</span>, <span class="filepath"> default.htm</span>, <span class="filepath"> default.html</span>, <span class="filepath"> default.cgi</span>, <span class="filepath"> default.asp</span>, <span class="filepath"> home.htm</span>, <span class="filepath"> home.html</span>, <span class="filepath"> home.cgi</span>, and<span class="filepath"> home.asp</span>. </p> <p>To disable filename stripping, specify a Default Page value that never occurs in your URLs. </p> </td>
