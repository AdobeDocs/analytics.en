# Manage Data Warehouse requests

You can view, duplicate, and re-prioritize requests that you have made in Data Warehouse. <!-- just those you have made? I think you can see other people's requests (you can filter by them). What can you do with other people's requests? Just view them?-->

To manage existing requests in Data Warehouse:

1. In Adobe Analytics, select [!UICONTROL **Tools**] > [!UICONTROL **Data Warehouse**].

1. Do any of the following: <!-- check to see what still applies and if there is new functionality -->

   * **Filter requests:** To filter requests by [!UICONTROL **Report Suite**], [!UICONTROL **Owner**], or [!UICONTROL **Status**], select the **Filter** icon <!-- this is new?-->

   * **Search for requests:** To search for requests, specify the request name in the search field. <!-- or by the login name of the requestor (still true?) It also used to say "by report name" instead of "request name" What's the difference?  -->.

   * View recent report requests by report name, segment applied, requestor, request date and status.

   * Duplicate requests. Click **[!UICONTROL Duplicate]** next to the request.

     >[!NOTE]
     >
     >This action duplicates only the request, not the schedule or the delivery details.

   * Re-prioritize reports by dragging and dropping them to a new location within the queue. <!-- still true? -->
   * To see when a request started processing, click on a scheduled request ID and examine the pop-up that opens. <!-- still true? -->

   * Select a job to see individual requests for that job. <!-- still true? -->

     * Rate Limited: Your organization has too many Data Warehouse requests running. The request is paused until other data requests complete. <!-- What is this?? -->
