# Custom calendar

Report builder uses the Analytics custom calendar. You can use the calendar to define the first day of the week and year, or use a different retail calendar style. The calendar formats are used to for various purposes, including sales comparison and forecast standardization, payroll cost analysis, or physical inventory count regulation.

 Each of the calendar formats is described below.

   <td colname="col2"> <p> Breaks down each month by the number of weeks in the month. Meaning, January has four weeks, and so on. The National Retail Federation uses the 4-5-4 calendar format. </p> </td>

   <td colname="col1"> <p>Custom Calendar </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p> Offers three formats based on the number of weeks in each month. The number of weeks in each month depends on the selected first day of the year. </p> <p>A year has 52 weeks. Divide that into 4 quarters and you get 13 weeks per quarter. But there are 3 months in a quarter. 13 is not divisible by three so you end up putting the extra week into one of the months so that it's always consistent. 5/4/4 means the 1st month of the quarter has the extra week. 4/5/4 means the 2nd month has the extra week, etc. In the 5-4-4 calendar, the 53rd week is added onto the last quarter of the year. </p>
