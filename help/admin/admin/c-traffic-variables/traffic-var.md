# Traffic variable (prop) overview

Custom Insight Traffic Variables (or props) enable you to correlate custom data with specific traffic-related events. The prop variables are embedded in the implementation code on each page of your website.

Use the [!UICONTROL Traffic Variables] page to enable, disable, or rename traffic variable reports. Once disabled, the report for a traffic variable does not appear in the user interface.
