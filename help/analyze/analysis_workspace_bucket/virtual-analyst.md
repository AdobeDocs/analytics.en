# Virtual Analyst

Your Adobe Analytics Virtual Analyst continuously analyzes data and uses predictive algorithms and machine learning to deliver personalized alerts and insights into unknown anomalies impacting your business. The combination of **Anomaly Detection** and **Contribution Analysis** lets you automate the most common and expensive data science workflows to identify whatâ€™s driving unusual behaviors in your data. **Intelligent Alerts** then pro-actively identifies and notifies you of those anomalies.
