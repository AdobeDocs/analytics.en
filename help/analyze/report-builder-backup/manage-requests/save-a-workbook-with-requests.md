# Save a workbook with requests

When you create reports with embedded requests, you can save them using **File** > **Save** or **File** > **Save As** in Excel. Report Builder detects whether the report contains requests. When you select one of the save options, complete the **Save Workbook As** form.

* As a best practice for any extensive work with Windows applications, Adobe recommends that you save your requests in the spreadsheet often and regularly to avoid an unexpected loss of requests in your worksheet.
* When naming your workbook, consider using a version number in the file name so that you can preserve a work history. For example, name your first workbook [!DNL web_forecast_01_01.xlsx].
* If you have already saved the report, the [!UICONTROL Save Template] form is not displayed when saving the report a second time. If the report contains no requests, this dialog box is not displayed. Instead, the standard Excel [!UICONTROL Save As] form is displayed.

## Filenames and location {#section_2406629E9B644CE08430826948977D5D}

The [!UICONTROL Save Template] form has some of the same functions as the standard Excel [!UICONTROL File] > [!UICONTROL Save As] dialog box, such as a text box for entering the file name of the spreadsheet report using the conventional [!DNL .xls] file extension.

Any file name you use must contain 255 characters or less. In addition, the file name may not contain the following characters:

\ ? | > < : / &#42; ' "

Finally, you cannot use Unicode characters beyond the set of extended ASCII characters.

When saving the file to a location on your local or network drives, you may enter the full path in the text box, or click on the browse button  ![browse_button.gif](assets/browse_button.gif) adjacent to the [!UICONTROL Save As] text box.
