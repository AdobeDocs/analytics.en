# Alerts - use cases

You can create alerts as described in [Create alerts](/help/components/c-alerts/alert-builder.md). 

The following sections illustrate example use cases to consider as you create alerts.

## Create simple alert filtered by two segments {#section_2E96FFFA93D44F7D8DBCEC97203204AA}

## Consolidate (stack) alerts instead of creating multiple alerts {#section_B27B0856BA104B9FB6D0BBB317633F18}

Stacking alerts ensures that alerts get combined and you don't get a number of separate alerts.
