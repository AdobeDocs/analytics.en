# Data Sources

The Data Sources feature allows you to import data to Analytics from offline sources. Once imported, this data can be treated and handled similarly to data that was collected natively.

Use Data Sources to:

* Integrate offline data with data collected from your web site. 
* Collect data from web servers, call centers, or other systems. Then import it into the Experience Cloud to see conversion from all avenues of your organization. 
* Optimize keyword bid management based on offline lead fulfillment through SearchCenter.

When Data Sources is activated on a report suite, an FTP location is provided so you can upload files to be integrated into reporting. Once uploaded, Adobe servers automatically process the data and integrate it into your report suite.
