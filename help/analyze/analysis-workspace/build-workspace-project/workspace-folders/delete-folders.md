# Delete Folders 

You can delete folders that you create.

**Guidelines**

*  Deleting a folder does not delete the contents of the folder. The contents of a deleted folder (projects or sub-folders) are moved to the immediate folder above in the folder hierarchy.
*  Admins can delete a folder within the Company folder that another admin created. Admins may need to coordinate with other Admins to keep folder and project access consistent. See [About Folders in Analytics](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/workspace-folders/about-folders.md)

To delete a folder

1.  Click the **â€¦** ellipsis icon in the top-right.
