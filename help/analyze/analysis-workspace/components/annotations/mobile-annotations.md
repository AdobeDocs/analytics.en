# Share Annotations in Mobile Scorecards

You can display annotations that are created in Workspaceâ€”in Mobile Scorecards. This allows you to share contextual data nuances and insights to your organization and campaigns directly within Scorecards.

Annotations in Mobile Scorecards work similarly to Workspace annotations with some additional features. In Workspace for example, you can create table-level annotations for a date range. In Mobile Scorecards, you view category-level annotations. This provides additional context for Mobile Scorecard users.

## Add Annotations to Mobile Scorecards

Annotations that are displayed in Mobile Scorecards are created in Workspace using the Workspace annotation creation methods. For information on creating annotations, see [Create Annotations](create-annotations.md).


1. Turn on annotations. To turn annotations on, see [Turn annotations on or off](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-components/annotations/overview.html?lang=en#turn-annotations-on-or-off).

1. Create an annotation and assign it to _global projects. To create an annotation in Workspace, see [Create Annotations](create-annotations.md).

1. Select **Show annotations** to display the annotation in Mobile Scorecards.

To confirm that show annotations is selected, go to **Project** > **Project info and settings**.

## View annotations in Mobile Scorecards

In Workspace, you can verify annotations in the Builder. You can also use the Preview mode to view the Mobile Scorecard with annotations.

To view annotations on a mobile device, in Mobile Scorecards, tap an annotation icon. Swipe left or right to view additional annotations. This allows you to quickly view all annotations.



When viewing a __donut, a summary of annotations applied to a metric is located in the lower right hand corner.




## Mobile Scorecard Annotation Considerations

* If an annotation is applied to a category and a user switches from that category view, the annotation disappears. Annotations are displayed only in an associated category.

* Annotations are turned off by default.


## Annotation colors

When you create an annotation, you assign a specific color to the annotation that is displayed in the Scorecard. Annotations appearing in grey indicate multiple annotations are assigned to the same category. Otherwise, the annotation appears in the color that was set in Workspace.
