# Adobe plug-in: getAndPersistValue

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This plug-in is provided by Adobe Consulting as a courtesy to help you get more value out of Adobe Analytics. Adobe Customer Care does not provide support with this plug-in, including installation or troubleshooting. If you require help with this plug-in, contact your organization's Account Manager. They can arrange a meeting with a consultant for assistance.

The `getAndPersistValue` plug-in allows you to store a value in a cookie that can be retrieved later during a visit. It serves a similar role to the [!UICONTROL Storage duration] feature using tags in Adobe Experience Platform. Adobe recommends using this plug-in if you want to automatically persist an Analytics variable to the same value in subsequent hits after the variable was set. This plug-in is not necessary if the [!UICONTROL Storage duration] feature in the Data Collection UI is sufficient. It is also not necessary to use this plug-in if you do not need to set and persist variables to the same value in subsequent hits. The built-in persistence of eVars does not require the use of this plug-in, since eVars persist server-side by Adobe.

## Install the plug-in using tags in Adobe Experience Platform

Adobe offers an extension that allows you to use most commonly-used plug-ins.

1. Log in to the [Data Collection UI](https://experience.adobe.com/data-collection) using your AdobeID credentials.
1. Click the desired property.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click on the [!UICONTROL Catalog] button
1. Install and publish the [!UICONTROL Common Analytics Plugins] extension
1. If you haven't already, create a rule labeled "Initialize Plug-ins" with the following configuration:
    * Condition: None
    * Event: Core – Library Loaded (Page Top)
1. Add an action to the above rule with the following configuration:
    * Extension: Common Analytics Plugins
    * Action Type: Initialize getAndPersistValue
1. Save and publish the changes to the rule.

## Install the plug-in using custom code editor

If you do not want to use the plug-in extension, you can use the custom code editor.

1. Log in to the [Data Collection UI](https://experience.adobe.com/data-collection) using your AdobeID credentials.
1. Click on the desired property.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click the [!UICONTROL Configure] button under the Adobe Analytics extension.
1. Expand the [!UICONTROL Configure tracking using custom code] accordion, which reveals the [!UICONTROL Open Editor] button.
1. Open the custom code editor and paste the plug-in code provided below into the edit window.
1. Save and publish the changes to the Analytics extension.

## Install the plug-in using AppMeasurement

Copy and paste the following code anywhere in the AppMeasurement file after the Analytics tracking object is instantiated (using [`s_gi`](../functions/s-gi.md)). Preserving comments and version numbers of the code in your implementation helps Adobe with troubleshooting any potential issues.

```js
/******************************************* BEGIN CODE TO DEPLOY *******************************************/
/* Adobe Consulting Plugin: getAndPersistValue v3.0 (Requires AppMeasurement) */
function getAndPersistValue(vtp,cn,ex){var d=vtp,k=cn,l=ex;if("undefined"!==typeof d&&"-v"===d)return{plugin:"getAndPersistValue",version:"3.0"};var a=function(){if("undefined"!==typeof window.s_c_il)for(var c=0,b;c<window.s_c_il.length;c++)if(b=window.s_c_il[c],b._c&&"s_c"===b._c)return b}();"undefined"!==typeof a&&(a.contextData.getAndPersistValue="3.0");window.cookieWrite=window.cookieWrite||function(c,b,f){if("string"===typeof c){var h=window.location.hostname,a=window.location.hostname.split(".").length-1;if(h&&!/^[0-9.]+$/.test(h)){a=2<a?a:2;var e=h.lastIndexOf(".");if(0<=e){for(;0<=e&&1<a;)e=h.lastIndexOf(".",e-1),a--;e=0<e?h.substring(e):h}}g=e;b="undefined"!==typeof b?""+b:"";if(f||""===b)if(""===b&&(f=-60),"number"===typeof f){var d=new Date;d.setTime(d.getTime()+6E4*f)}else d=f;return c&&(document.cookie=encodeURIComponent(c)+"="+encodeURIComponent(b)+"; path=/;"+(f?" expires="+d.toUTCString()+";":"")+(g?" domain="+g+";":""),"undefined"!==typeof cookieRead)?cookieRead(c)===b:!1}};window.cookieRead=window.cookieRead||function(c){if("string"===typeof c)c=encodeURIComponent(c);else return"";var b=" "+document.cookie,a=b.indexOf(" "+c+"="),d=0>a?a:b.indexOf(";",a);return(c=0>a?"":decodeURIComponent(b.substring(a+2+c.length,0>d?b.length:d)))?c:""};a=new Date;k=k?k:"s_gapv";(l=l?l:0)?a.setTime(a.getTime()+864E5*l):a.setTime(a.getTime()+18E5);"undefined"!==typeof d&&d||(d=cookieRead(k));cookieWrite(k,d,a);return d};
/******************************************** END CODE TO DEPLOY ********************************************/
```

## Use the plug-in

The `getAndPersist` function uses the following arguments:

* **`vtp`** (required): The value to persist from page to page
* **`cn`** (optional): The name of the cookie to store the value. If this argument is not set, The cookie is named `"s_gapv"`
* **`ex`** (optional): The number of days before the cookie expires. If this argument is `0` or is not set, the cookie expires at the end of the visit (30 minutes of inactivity).

If the variable in the `vtp` argument is set, then the plug-in sets the cookie then returns the cookie value. If the variable in the `vtp` argument is not set, then the plug-in only returns the cookie value.

## Examples

```js
// Sets eVar21 to "raccoon", and sets the ev21gapv cookie to "raccoon" (which expires in 28 days).
s.eVar21 = "raccoon";
s.eVar21 = getAndPersistValue(s.eVar21,"ev21gapv",28);

// Checks the "ev21gapv" cookie for a value and assigns it to eVar21. It does not set a cookie value or reset an existing cookie's expiration since the value is not set on the page.
// If there is a cookie, assigns eVar21 to that value. Otherwise, eVar21 is blank.
s.eVar21 = getAndPersistValue(s.eVar21,"ev21gapv",28);

// Checks the "ev21gapv" cookie for a value and assigns it to prop35. It does not set a cookie value or reset an existing cookie's expiration since eVar21 is not set on the page.
s.prop35 = getAndPersistValue(s.eVar21,"ev21gapv",28);

// Sets eVar21 to "panda", and sets the ev21gapv cookie to "panda" (which expires in 14 days). It then sets prop35 to the value contained in the ev21gapv cookie.
// Ultimately both eVar21 and prop35 contain the value "panda".
s.eVar21 = "panda";
s.prop35 = getAndPersistValue(s.eVar21,"ev21gapv",14);

// Sets eVar30 to "shopping", and sets the s_gapv cookie to "shopping" (which expires at the end of the browser session).
s.eVar30 = "shopping";
s.eVar30 = getAndPersistValue(s.eVar30);
```
