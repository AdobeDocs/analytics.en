Combo charts make it easy to quickly build a comparison visualization without having to build a table first. You can easily view your data in a line/bar combination that facilitates understanding trends. 

Use combo charts to 

* Easily compare this week's orders to orders at the same time last month (and last year) - all within a few clicks. 

* Quickly analyze and compare multiple metrics (like unique visitors and revenue) against one another on the same chart. 

* Analyze a metric against a function (like cumulative average) over a time horizon.
