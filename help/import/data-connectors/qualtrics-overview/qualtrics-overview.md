# Qualtrics Data Connector for Adobe Analytics{#qualtrics-data-connector-for-adobe-analytics}

This integration combines the customer research capabilities of the Qualtrics Research Suite with the rich data you are collecting within Adobe Analytics to create powerful analytics and optimization opportunities for your organization.

This two-way integration first connects the Qualtrics survey response data with your visitor clickstream data. It then injects relevant behavioral actions and attributes, from Adobe Analytics, back into the Qualtrics survey reporting.

## Key Benefits and Features{#key-benefits-and-features}

* Traffic and conversion reporting based on survey, question and response level detail.
* Uses only 1 ListVar, 1 eVar, and 1 event to integrate unlimited Qualtrics surveys.
* Enhance Qualtrics reporting with up to 5 custom conversion dimensions, 5 custom traffic dimensions, 5 custom success events and more than 20 other standard metrics and dimensions tracked with Adobe Analytics.
* Integrated survey data within Adobe Analytics flows in "live" as surveys are submitted. Exports to Qualtrics occur daily.
