# Engineering Services engagements with FTP

Many Adobe Engineering Services engagements involve the exchange of data, which frequently requires FTP.

These engagements include [!UICONTROL DB VISTA] and custom projects.

For information on FTP limits and data retention, see [FTP Limits and Data Retention](/help/export/ftp-and-sftp/ftp-limits.md).

## DB VISTA {#section_D1AC697356DA4B92B7A7F074ED76147F}

Similar to a SAINT upload via FTP, [!UICONTROL DB VISTA] receives data through an FTP upload. For more information on file formats and the [!UICONTROL DB VISTA] upload process, refer to the [!UICONTROL DB VISTA] Introduction to [!UICONTROL DB VISTA]white paper, which can be found in the Adobe Suite Help site by going to **[!UICONTROL Supporting Docs]** > **[!UICONTROL White Papers]**.

## Custom Engagements {#section_A2A251CFB38D47CA9CDA73C5B00F5DDA}

Adobe Engineering Services offers custom projects that use both FTP and SFTP. See Adobe Engineering Services for more information on custom projects. For information on SFTP, see [Secure File Transfer Protocol](/help/export/ftp-and-sftp/c-sftp/ftp-sftp.md).
