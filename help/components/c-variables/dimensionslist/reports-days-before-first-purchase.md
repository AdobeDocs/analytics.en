# Days Before First Purchase

Displays the number of days that pass between the first time customers visit your site and when they finally make a purchase.

 For example, if a visitor purchases one day after first visiting, then any visit or event will display on the *1 day* line item in the report, for the remainder of the visitor's cookie life.
