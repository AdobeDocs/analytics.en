# Internal URL filters

Internal URL filters allow you to identify the referrers that you consider internal to your site. They help traffic sources reports populate data and help filter internal traffic.

A referrer, or referring page, is typically the page from which a visitor entered your site. To avoid skewing data, you can filter out internal referrers. Reports exclude filtered referrers from the [Referrers](/help/components/dimensions/referrer.md) dimension, the [Referring domains](/help/components/dimensions/referring-domain.md) dimension, and other traffic source dimensions.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Some report suites have an internal URL filter of a period (.) configured by default. When this filter exists, all traffic is classified as internal. Referrer reports do not work until the period (.) filter is removed. 

To check which internal URL filters are configured for a report suite: <!-- I don't see the period in my instance? Is the following information valid? "To avoid this, remove the rule listing a period (.) as a filter, and add your own site. The reason why a period is the default internal URL filter is to allow data to be collected in the Pages report. If hits do not match internal URL filters, all pages come up as Other. A period is always somewhere in the URL, which guarantees the Pages report is populated.")-->
