# PathFinder

The goal of the PathFinder report is to help you further dissect your full paths into fragments, yielding the precise patterns that are instrumental to optimizing your site.

 The power of this report is in the Filter wizard that allows you to specify selection criteria that will be used to generate the report. Using the Filter capability, you can analyze the path fragments, querying for ones that begin with a certain page, end with a certain page, or even ones that begin with one page and end with another.
