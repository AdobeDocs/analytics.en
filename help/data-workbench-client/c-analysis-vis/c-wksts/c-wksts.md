# Worksheets

Data workbench provides worksheets for creating ad hoc filters and metrics for the current visualization.

 A worksheet is similar to an ordinary spreadsheet, but unlike a spreadsheet, every cell containing a formula can define a metric.

Unlike metrics created using the [!UICONTROL Metric Editor], metrics defined using worksheets do not appear in the metric menus, but can be saved and included in any of your workspaces.

For information about the [!UICONTROL Metric Editor], see [Creating and Editing Derived Metrics](../../../data-workbench-client/c-admin-intrf/c-prof-mgr/c-drvd-mtrcs.md#concept_E41723B342A849309874B26232224A40).
