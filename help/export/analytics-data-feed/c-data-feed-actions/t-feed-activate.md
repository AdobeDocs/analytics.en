# Activate a Feed

You can activate a paused or inactive feed.

Activating a feed restarts processing from the moment it was paused. For example, if a daily feed was paused for 20 days, it resumes delivering the feeds from 20 days ago and forward. 

1. Select one or more paused or inactive feeds.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Activate]**.
