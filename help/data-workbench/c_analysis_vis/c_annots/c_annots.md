# Annotations

Annotations are windows that users can add to a workspace to contain descriptive comments, graphics, or dynamic titles.

 Annotations also can be added to workspaces as callouts. For information about working with annotation callouts, see [Adding Callouts to a Workspace](../../c_vis/c_call_wkspc.md#concept_212B09E763044D938987B4A9C658ADC0).
