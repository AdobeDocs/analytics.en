# Create a data feed

When creating a data feed, you provide Adobe with:

* The information about the destination where you want raw data files to be sent
* The data you want to include in each file

Before you create a data feed, it's important to have a basic understanding of data feeds and to ensure that you meet all prerequisites. For more information, see [Data feeds overview](data-feed-overview.md).

1. Log in to [experiencecloud.adobe.com](https://experiencecloud.adobe.com) using your Adobe ID credentials.

1. Select the 9-square icon in the upper-right, then select [!UICONTROL **Analytics**].

1. In the top navigation bar, go to [!UICONTROL **Admin**] > [!UICONTROL **Data feeds**].

1. Select [!UICONTROL **Create data feed**]. 

    <!-- add screenshot -->

    A page displays with the following categories: [!UICONTROL **Details**], [!UICONTROL **Data formatting**], [!UICONTROL **Data structure**], [!UICONTROL **Schedule**], and [!UICONTROL **Destination**].

1. In the [!UICONTROL **Details**] section, complete the following fields:
   
   | Field | Function | 
   |---------|----------|
   | [!UICONTROL **Name**] | The name of the data feed. Must be unique within the selected report suite, and can be up to 255 characters in length. [Learn more](/help/export/analytics-data-feed/df-faq.md#must-feed-names-be-unique) | 
   | [!UICONTROL **Tags**] | Apply any tags to the data feed for easier categorization.  |
   | [!UICONTROL **Description**] | Specify a description for the data feed. |

1. In the [!UICONTROL **Data formatting**] section, specify the following information:
   
   | Field | Function | 
   |---------|----------|
   | [!UICONTROL **Compression format**] | The type of compression used. **Gzip** outputs files in `.tar.gz` format. **Zip** outputs files in `.zip` format. | 
   | [!UICONTROL **Packaging type**] | Select [!UICONTROL **Multiple files**] for most data feeds. This option paginates your data into uncompressed 2GB chunks. (If the [!UICONTROL **Multiple files**] option is selected and uncompressed data for the reporting window is less than 2GB, one file is sent.) Selecting **Single file** outputs the `hit_data.tsv` file in a single, potentially massive file.  |
   | [!UICONTROL **Manifest**] | Choose whether to include a manifest file with each data feed delivery. <p>You can choose from the following options:</p><ul><li>**[!UICONTROL Manifest file]**: Contains information for each included file in the data feed.</li><li>**[!UICONTROL Finish file (Legacy)]**: Indicates that the data feed completed successfully. No other information is included. This option is suitable for existing feeds that originally used this option that need to be reprocessed. It is available only when sending data feed data in a single package. </li><li>**[!UICONTROL None]**: No file is included</li></ul> |
   | [!UICONTROL **Send manifest file even when no data exists**] | Determines whether Adobe should deliver a [manifest file](/help/export/analytics-data-feed/c-df-contents/datafeeds-contents.md#feed-manifest) to the destination when no data is collected for a feed interval. If you select **Manifest file**, you receive a manifest file similar to the following when no data is collected:<p>`text`</p><p>`Datafeed-Manifest-Version: 1.0`</p><p>`Lookup-Files: 0`</p><p>`Data-Files: 0`</p><p> `Total-Records: 0`</p>  |
   | [!UICONTROL **Replace operating system strings**] | When collecting data, some characters (such as newlines) can cause issues. Select this option to have these characters removed from feed files.<p>This option detects the following string sequences embedded in customer data and replaces them with a space:</p> <ul><li>**Windows:** CRLF, CR, or TAB</li><li>**Mac and Linux:** \n, \r, or \t</li></ul>  | 
   | [!UICONTROL **Enable dynamic lookups**] | Dynamic lookups allow you to receive additional lookup files in your data feed otherwise not available. This setting enables the following lookup tables to be sent with each data feed file:<ul><li> **Carrier name**</li><li>**Mobile attributes**</li><li>**Operating system type**</li></ul><p>For more information, see [Dynamic lookups](/help/export/analytics-data-feed/c-df-contents/dynamic-lookups.md).</p> | 

1. In the [!UICONTROL **Data structure**] section, in the **[!UICONTROL Report suite]** field, select the source report suite that contains the data that you want to export. <p>Consider the following when selecting a report suite:</p> <ul><li>If multiple data feeds are created for the same report suite, each data feed must have different column definitions.</li><li>Only source report suites support data feeds; virtual report suites are not supported.</li><li>column lists are company-specific. If you choose a report suite that is owned by Company A and you're already in Company B, then the list will change. </li></ul>

1. Use either or both of the following methods to determine which data columns to include in the feed:

   * **Add columns individually:** In the **[!UICONTROL Available]** section on the left, select any columns that you want to include, then select **[!UICONTROL Include]**. All available data columns in Adobe Analytics are available. You can select multiple columns by holding **[!UICONTROL Shift]**, or by holding **[!UICONTROL Command]** (on macOS) or **[!UICONTROL Ctrl]** (on Windows). Click **[!UICONTROL Add all]** to include all columns in a data feed.

     Columns you add appear in the **[!UICONTROL Included]** section on the right.

   * **Add a column template:** In the **[!UICONTROL Column templates]** field, select a column template to add. A column template is a predefined group of columns, and Adobe provides several by default. 
  
     All columns included in the template appear in the **[!UICONTROL Included]** section on the right.

1. (Optional) If you plan to create additional data feeds that include these same columns, you can create a column template that is based on this data feed. To create a column template, select **[!UICONTROL Save as template]**, specify a name for the template, then select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

    ![Create column template while creating a data feed](assets/data-feed-template-create2.png)

1. (Optional) To download a list of included columns in .csv format, select **[!UICONTROL Download columns]**. This can be especially helpful for data feeds with a large number of columns. 

1. In the [!UICONTROL **Schedule**] section, specify the following information:
   
   | Field | Function | 
   |---------|----------|
   | [!UICONTROL **Frequency**] | Select how often the data feed should be sent. The following options are available:<ul><li>**Daily**: Feeds contain a full day's worth of data, from midnight to midnight in the report suite's time zone. Use this option for backfill or historical data, or for continuing feeds.</li><li>**Hourly**: Feeds contain a single hour's worth of data. Use this option for continuing feeds.</li><li>**Every 15 minutes**: Feeds contain 15 minute's worth of data. Use this option for continuing feeds.</li></ul>  | 
   | [!UICONTROL **Processing delay**] | Wait a given amount of time before processing a data feed file. A delay can be useful to give mobile implementations an opportunity for offline devices to come online and send data. It can also be used to accommodate your organization's server-side processes in managing previously processed files. In most cases, no delay is needed. A feed can be delayed by up to 120 minutes. |
   | [!UICONTROL **Continuous feed**] | This checkbox removes the end date, allowing a feed to run indefinitely. When a feed finishes processing historical data, a feed waits for data to finish collecting for a given hour or day. Once the current hour or day concludes, processing begins after the specified delay. |
   | [!UICONTROL **Start date**] | The start date indicates the date when you want the data feed to begin. To immediately begin processing data feeds for historical data, set this date to any date in the past when data is being collected. The start date is based on the report suite's time zone. |
   | [!UICONTROL **End date**] | The end date indicates the date when you want the data feed to end. The end date is based on the report suite's time zone. | 

1. In the [!UICONTROL **Destination**] section, configure the destination where you want the data to be sent.  

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Consider the following when configuring a report destination:
   >
   >* We recommend using a cloud account for your report destination. [Legacy FTP and SFTP accounts](#legacy-destinations) are available, but are not recommended.
   >* Any cloud accounts that you previously configured are available to use for Data Feeds. You can configure cloud accounts in any of the following ways:
   >
   >   * When configuring cloud accounts for [Data Warehouse](/help/export/data-warehouse/create-request/dw-request-report-destinations.md) 
   >   
   >   * When [importing Adobe Analytics classification data](/help/components/locations/locations-manager.md) (Any locations that are configured for importing classification data cannot be used.)
   >   
   >   * From the Locations manager, in [Components > Locations](/help/components/locations/configure-import-accounts.md) 
   >
   >* Cloud accounts are associated with your Adobe Analytics user account. Other users cannot use or view cloud accounts that you configure.
   >
   >* You can edit any locations that you create from the Locations manager in [Components > Locations](/help/components/locations/configure-import-accounts.md)

   Complete the following fields:
   
   | Field | Function | 
   |---------|----------|
   | [!UICONTROL **Account**] | Do either of the following:<ul><li>**Use an existing account:** Select the drop-down menu next to the **[!UICONTROL Account]** field. Or, begin typing the account name, then select it from the drop-down menu. <p>Accounts are available to you only if you configured them or if they were shared with an organization you are a part of.</p></li><li>**Create a new account:** Select **[!UICONTROL Add new]** beneath the **[!UICONTROL Account]** field. For information about how to configure the account, see [Configure a location account](/help/components/locations/configure-import-accounts.md#configure-a-location-account) in [Configure cloud import and export accounts](/help/components/locations/configure-import-accounts.md).</li></ul> |

   Use any of the following destination types when creating a data feed. For configuration instructions, expand the destination type. (Additional [legacy destinations](#legacy-destinations) are also available, but are not recommended.)

   +++Amazon S3

   You can send feeds directly to Amazon S3 buckets. This destination type requires only your Amazon S3 account and the location (bucket). 

   Adobe Analytics uses cross-account authentication to upload files from Adobe Analytics to the specified location in your Amazon S3 instance.

   When using Amazon S3 with Data Feeds, only SSE-S3 encryption is supported.

   To configure an Amazon S3 bucket as the destination for a data feed:

   1. Begin creating a data feed as described in [Create and configure a data feed](#create-and-configure-a-data-feed).
   
   1. In the [!UICONTROL **Destination**] section, in the [!UICONTROL **Type**] drop-down menu, select [!UICONTROL **Amazon S3**].

      ![Amazon S3 destination](assets/datafeed-destination-amazons3.png)

   1. Select [!UICONTROL **Select location**].

      The Amazon S3 Export Locations page is displayed.

   1. (Conditional) If an Amazon S3 account (and a location on that account) has already been configured in Adobe Analytics, you can use it as your data feed destination: 

      >[!NOTE]

This permission allows the User ARN to upload initial files and overwrite files for subsequent uploads.</p><p>Bucket names must meet specific naming rules. For example, they must be between 3 to 63 characters long, can consist only of lowercase letters, numbers, dots (.), and hyphens (-), and must begin and end with a letter or number. [A complete list of naming rules are available in the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html). </p> | 
         | [!UICONTROL **Prefix**] | The folder within the bucket where you want to put the data. Specify a folder name, then add a backslash after the name to create the folder. For example, `folder_name/` |

         {style="table-layout:auto"}

      1. Select [!UICONTROL **Create**] > [!UICONTROL **Save**].

         The destination is now configured to send data to the Amazon S3 location that you specified.

      1. (Conditional) If you need to manage the destination (account and location) that you just created, it is available in the [Locations manager](/help/components/locations/locations-manager.md).
   
   +++

   +++Azure RBAC

   You can send feeds directly to an Azure container by using RBAC authentication. This destination type requires an Application ID, Tenant ID, and Secret. 

   To configure an Azure RBAC account as the destination for a data feed:

   1. If you haven't already, create an Azure application that Adobe Analytics can use for authentication, then grant access permissions in access control (IAM). 
   
      For information, refer to the [Microsoft Azure documentation about how to create an Azure Active Directory application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal).

   |Field | Function | 
   |---------|----------|
   | [!UICONTROL **Remove escaped characters**] | When collecting data, some characters (such as newlines) can cause issues. Check this box if you would like these characters removed from feed files. |
   | [!UICONTROL **Compression format**] | The type of compression used. **Gzip** outputs files in `.tar.gz` format. **Zip** outputs files in `.zip` format. | 
   | [!UICONTROL **Packaging type**] | Select [!UICONTROL **Multiple files**] for most data feeds. This option paginates your data into uncompressed 2GB chunks. (If the [!UICONTROL **Multiple files**] option is selected and uncompressed data for the reporting window is less than 2GB, one file is sent.) Selecting **Single file** outputs the `hit_data.tsv` file in a single, potentially massive file. |
   | [!UICONTROL **Manifest**] | Determines whether Adobe should deliver a [manifest file](c-df-contents/datafeeds-contents.md#feed-manifest) to the destination when no data is collected for a feed interval. If you select **Manifest File**, you receive a manifest file similar to the following when no data is collected:<p>`text`</p><p>`Datafeed-Manifest-Version: 1.0`</p><p>`Lookup-Files: 0`</p><p>`Data-Files: 0`</p><p> `Total-Records: 0`</p> | 
   | [!UICONTROL **Column templates**] | When creating many data feeds, Adobe recommends creating a column template. Selecting a column template automatically includes the specified columns in the template. Adobe also provides several templates by default. |
   | [!UICONTROL **Available columns**] | All available data columns in Adobe Analytics. Click [!UICONTROL Add all] to include all columns in a data feed. |
   | [!UICONTROL **Included columns**] | The columns to include in a data feed. Click [!UICONTROL Remove all] to remove all columns from a data feed. |
   | [!UICONTROL **Download CSV**] | Downloads a CSV file containing all included columns. |

1. Select [!UICONTROL **Save**] in the top-right.

    Historical data processing begins immediately. When data finishes processing for a day, the file is sent to the destination that you configured.

    For information about how to access the data feed and to get a better understanding of its contents, see [Data feed contents - overview](/help/export/analytics-data-feed/c-df-contents/datafeeds-contents.md).

## Legacy destinations

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The destinations described in this section are legacy, and are not recommended. Instead, use one of the following destinations when creating a data feed: Amazon S3, Google Cloud Platform, Azure RBAC, or Azure SAS. See [Create and configure a data feed](#create-and-configure-a-data-feed) for detailed information about each of these recommended destinations. 


The following information provides configuration information for each of the legacy destinations:

### FTP

Data feed data can be delivered to an Adobe or customer-hosted FTP location. Requires an FTP host, username, and password. Use the path field to place feed files in a folder. Folders must already exist; feeds throw an error if the specified path does not exist.

Use the following information when completing the available fields:

* [!UICONTROL **Host**]: Enter the desired FTP destination URL. For example, `ftp://ftp.omniture.com`.
* [!UICONTROL **Path**]: Can be left blank
* [!UICONTROL **Username**]: Enter the username to log in to the FTP site.
* [!UICONTROL **Password and confirm password**]: Enter the password to log in to the FTP site.

### SFTP

SFTP support for data feeds is available. Requires an SFTP host, username, and the destination site to contain a valid RSA or DSA public key. You can download the appropriate public key when creating the feed.

### S3

You can send feeds directly to Amazon S3 buckets. This destination type requires a Bucket name, an Access Key ID, and a Secret Key. See [Amazon S3 bucket naming requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-s3-bucket-naming-requirements.html) within the Amazon S3 docs for more information.

The user you provide for uploading data feeds must have the following [permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_Operations_Amazon_Simple_Storage_Service.html):

* s3:GetObject
* s3:PutObject
* s3:PutObjectAcl

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >For each upload to an Amazon S3 bucket, [!DNL Analytics] adds the bucket owner to the BucketOwnerFullControl ACL, regardless of whether the bucket has a policy that requires it. For more information, see "[What is the BucketOwnerFullControl setting for Amazon S3 data feeds?](df-faq.md#BucketOwnerFullControl)"

The following 16 standard AWS regions are supported (using the appropriate signature algorithm where necessary):

* us-east-2
* us-east-1
* us-west-1
* us-west-2
* ap-south-1
* ap-northeast-2
* ap-southeast-1
* ap-southeast-2
* ap-northeast-1
* ca-central-1
* eu-central-1
* eu-west-1
* eu-west-2
* eu-west-3
* eu-north-1
* sa-east-1

>[!NOTE]
>
>The cn-north-1 region is not supported.

### Azure Blob

Data feeds support Azure Blob destinations. Requires a container, account, and a key. Amazon automatically encrypts the data at rest. When you download the data, it gets decrypted automatically. See [Create a storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-portal#view-and-copy-storage-access-keys) within the Microsoft Azure docs for more information.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You must implement your own process to manage disk space on the feed destination. Adobe does not delete any data from the server.
