# Data Insertion API

The [Data Insertion API](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/1.4/guides/data-insertion/) and [Bulk Data Insertion API](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/2.0/guides/endpoints/bulk-data-insertion/) are both methods to submit server-side collection data to Adobe Analytics. Data Insertion API calls are made one event at a time. Bulk Data Insertion API accepts CSV formatted files containing event data, one event per row. 

If you are working on a new implementation of server-side collection, Adobe strongly recommends using the Bulk Data Insertion API.
