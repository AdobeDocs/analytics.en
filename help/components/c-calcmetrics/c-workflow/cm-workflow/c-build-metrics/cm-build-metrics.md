# Build Metrics

The Calculated Metrics Builder provides a canvas to drag and drop Dimensions, Metrics, Segments, and Functions to create custom metrics based on container hierarchy logic, rules, and operators. This integrated development tool lets you build and save simple calculated metrics or complex advanced calculated metrics.

There are several ways to get to the Calculated Metric Builder:

* In Analysis Workspace, open a project and click  **[!UICONTROL + New]** > **[!UICONTROL Create Metric]** .
* In [!DNL Analytics], go to **[!UICONTROL Components]** > **[!UICONTROL Calculated Metrics]**.

* Click **[!UICONTROL + Add]** at the top of the [Calculated Metric Manager](/help/components/c-calcmetrics/c-workflow/cm-workflow/cm-manager.md), or 

* Go to **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Reports]**, open any report and click the Metrics icon  ![](assets/metrics_icon.png) to bring up the Metrics rail, then click **[!UICONTROL Add]**.
