# Tag segments

In the [Segment manager](seg-manage.md), you can use tags to organize segments. Administrators can tag all segments. Non administroators can tags only the segments they create or have been shared with them.

To tag one or more segments:

1. In the [Segment manager](seg-manage.md), select one or more of the segments you want to tag.
1. From the action bar, select ![Labels](/help/assets/icons/Labels.svg) **[!UICONTROL Tag]**.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Tag Segment]** dialog:
   
   ![Tag Segments dialog](assets/segments-tag.png)

   1. (optionally) use ![Search](/help/assets/icons/Search.svg) to search for and limit the list of tags.

   2. Based on the list of tags:
   
      * select one or more existing tags from the list, or
      * enter a new tag and press **[!UICONTROL ENTER]**. Repeat to add more than one new tag.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save the tags for the segment. Select **[!UICONTROL Cancel]** to cancel.

Once saved, the tags are listed in the [!UICONTROL Tag] field for the selected segments in the [Segment builder](seg-builder.md).
