# Metrics

Metrics are the foundation of reports and help you view and understand data relationships and enable side-by-side comparisons of different data sets about your website. Metrics are quantitative information about visitor activity, such as views, click-throughs, reloads, average time spent, units, orders, revenue, and so on.

## Metrics overview

Metrics are the foundation of reports and help you view and understand data relationships and enable side-by-side comparisons of different data sets about your website. Metrics are quantitative information about visitor activity, such as views, click-throughs, reloads, average time spent, units, orders, revenue, and so on.

Metrics and associated data are displayed in the columns of reports. Traffic metrics show data about the volume of visitors. Conversion metrics show data about success events, such as purchases, downloads, or any other action that you want users to take on your website.

[Calculated metrics](/help/components/c-calcmetrics/cm-overview.md) are created by combining metrics.

For a full list of metrics, see [Metrics overview](/help/components/metrics/overview.md) in the Components user guide.

## Select default report metrics 

Steps that describe how to select default metrics at the report level.

<!-- 

t_metrics_set_default.xml

 -->

1. Run a report.
1. Add the metrics that you would like to save as the default metrics.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Add Metrics]** drop-down list, then select **[!UICONTROL Set as Default]**.

   The selected metrics are saved as the defaults for this report. The following information applies to default metrics:

* Default metrics apply across all user accounts, but is per report and report suite. For example, all users viewing a specific report in the same report suite display the metrics set using the preceding procedure.
* If you move between reports, the metrics displayed in the most recently viewed report persist. To display default metrics in that new report, click the [!UICONTROL Add Metrics] drop-down list, then click [!UICONTROL Show Defaults].

* Clicking [!UICONTROL Clear Defaults] removes the default metrics for that report and reverts them to the original default metrics for that report ( [!UICONTROL Page Views] for props, and whatever you have set in Admin Tools for eVars).
