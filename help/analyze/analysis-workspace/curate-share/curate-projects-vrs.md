# VRS and project curation

When you curate projects or virtual reports suites (VRSs), you essentially filter out components so that your audience sees only those project/VRS components (dimensions, metrics, segments, date ranges) that you want them to use.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Product profiles are the primary mechanism governing which components a user can see. They are managed through the [Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/manage-products-and-profiles.html#createproductprofiles). Curation is a secondary filter.

We have recently improved the curation experience. Here is an overview of what the **[!UICONTROL Show All]** button reveals, in addition to the curated components already available, in different curated experiences and by permission level:

|Curation Type|Admins|Non-Admin project owners|Non-Admins|
|---|---|---|---|
|Curated VRS|All non-curated VRS components|Non-curated VRS components that this role owns or that have been shared with them|Non-curated VRS components that this role owns or that have been shared with them|
|Curated Project|All non-curated project components|All non-curated project components|Non-curated project components that this role owns or that have been shared with them|
|Curated Project in a Curated VRS| All non-curated components, shown under **[!UICONTROL Non-Curated Project Components]** and **[!UICONTROL Non-Curated VRS Components]**| All non-curated project components AND non-curated VRS components that this role owns or that have been shared with them|Non-curated VRS and project components that this role owns or that have been shared with them|

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>VRS curation is always applied before project curation. This means that even if your curated project includes certain components, they will be filtered out if the curated VRS does not include them.
