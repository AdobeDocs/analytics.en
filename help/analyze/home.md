| Tool      | Description    |
|-----------|----------------|
| **[Analysis Workspace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.html)** | Analysis Workspace is a flexible browser tool that allows you to quickly build analyses and share insights. Using the drag-and-drop interface, you can craft your analysis, add visualizations to bring data to life, curate a dataset, share and schedule projects with anyone in your organization. |
| **[Analytics dashboards](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/mobapp/home.html)** | Analytics dashboards and their mobile scorecards allow executive users to view a broad rendering of important summary data quickly and easily on their own mobile devices. Curators add visualizations to mobile scorecard projects and share them with executives.  <br>Scorecards provide a way to target and measure KPIs and provide a clear indication of how well organizations are working to achieve their targets. |
| **[Activity Map](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/activity-map/activity-map.html)** | Activity Map is an Adobe Analytics application that is designed to rank link activity using visual overlays and provide a dashboard of real-time analytics to monitor audience engagement of your web pages. <br>Activity Map lets you set up different views to visually identify the acceleration of customer activity, quantify marketing initiatives, and act on audience needs and behaviors." |
| **[Report Builder](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/report-builder/home.html)** | Report Builder is an add-in for Microsoft Excel. Report Builder lets you build customized requests from Adobe Analytics data that are inserted into your Excel worksheets. Requests can dynamically reference cells within your worksheet, and you can update and customize how Report Builder presents the data. |
| **[Analytics APIs](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/2.0/)** | Analytics APIs allow you to directly call Adobe's servers to perform almost any action that you can perform in the user interface. You can create reports to explore, get insights, or answer important questions about your data. You can also manage components of Adobe Analytics, such as the creation of segments or calculated metrics. |
| **[Reports & Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/reports-analytics/getting-started.html)** | Reports & Analytics is a tool with dozens of pre-built reports and visualizations. These are now available within Analysis Workspace. **Effective December 31, 2023, Adobe intends to discontinue Reports & Analytics and its accompanying reports and features. Adobe recommends using Analysis Workspace for most reporting needs.** For additional information, see [Analysis Workspace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.html). |
