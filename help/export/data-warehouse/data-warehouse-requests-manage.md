# Manage Data Warehouse requests

The Request Manager lets you view, duplicate, and re-prioritize requests.

In Data Warehouse, select the **[!UICONTROL Request Manager]** tab.

Working in this tab lets you

* View recent report requests by report name, segment applied, requestor, request date and status. 
* Duplicate requests. Click **[!UICONTROL Duplicate]** next to the request. 

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >This action duplicates only the request, not the schedule or the delivery details.

* Search for reports by report name or by the login name of the requestor. 
* Re-prioritize reports by dragging and dropping them to a new location within the queue. 
* To see when a request started processing, click on a scheduled request ID and examine the pop-up that opens.

>[!NOTE]
