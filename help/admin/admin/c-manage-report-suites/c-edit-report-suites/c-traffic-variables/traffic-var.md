# Traffic variables (props) overview

Custom Insight Traffic Variables (or props) enable you to correlate custom data with specific traffic-related events. The prop variables are embedded in the implementation code on each page of your website.

>[!TIP]
>
>Adobe recommends using [eVars](/help/implement/vars/page-vars/evar.md) in most cases. In previous versions of Adobe Analytics, props and eVars had advantages and disadvantages to each other. However, Adobe has improved eVars to an extent that they now fulfill almost all use cases for props.
