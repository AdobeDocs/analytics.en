# Page View

A Page View is counted for each server call that is sent. This metric represents total instances of Page View. TrackLink calls are not counted as page views and do not increment the Page Views metric.

 A useful way to use the Page View metric is to run a **[!UICONTROL Paths]** > **[!UICONTROL Pages]** > **[!UICONTROL Entry Pages]** report, sort by it, and see which entry pages drive the most page views.
