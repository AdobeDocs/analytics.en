# Segments overview

You can create and use segments in Analysis Workspace and Customer Journey Analytics, depending on how complex they need to be, whether they should apply to this project only, and more. Here is a summary of segment types:

| Segment type | Where | Applicable where? | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Component-list segment | See how to [create a segment](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-create.md). | All your Workspace projects | For more complex segments, sequential segments |
| Quick segment | [Quick segment builder](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/segments/quick-segments.md) | Project only, but can save and add to your segment list. | Can be used for ad hoc single-rule segments (with drag-and-drop), or to add/edit multiple rules (by clicking the Segment icon) |
| Calculated metrics-based segment | [Calculated metric builder](/help/components/calculated-metrics/workflow/c-build-metrics/metrics-with-segments.md) | To individual calculated metric | Apply segment/s within your metric definition |
| Virtual report suite-based segment | [Virtual report suite builder](/help/components/vrs/c-workflow-vrs/vrs-create.md) | To individual virtual report suite | Apply segment/s within your virtual report suite definition |

## Create segments {#section_693CFADA668B4542B982446C2B4CF0F5}

You can create different types of segments in Analysis Workspace:

* [Quick segments](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/segments/quick-segments.md)
* [Regular segments](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-create.md) that you create in the [Segment builder](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-build.md) and that end up in the [Segment manager](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-manage.md)

## Segment comparison

Segment comparison comprises the following features:

* [Segment comparison panel:](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/c-panels/c-segment-comparison/segment-comparison.md) Allows you to drag two segments into the panel, and view a comprehensive report that shows statistically significant differences and overlap between the two audiences.
* [Comparing segments in fallout:](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/fallout/compare-segments-fallout.md) See how different audiences compare to each other in context of a fallout visualization.
