>[!NOTE]
>
>The following information is related to FTP and SFTP destination types. FTP and SFTP are legacy destination types. When configuring a data feed, you should use a cloud destination type, which are more secure. For more information about configuring cloud destination types for a Data Feed, see [Create a Data Feed](/help/export/analytics-data-feed/create-feed.md).

You can configure Adobe data to be sent to an external FTP account using SFTP.
