# Segments

Segments are custom subsets of data, or data filtered by rules that you create.

Segments are based on:

* Hits 
* Visitors 
* Visits

For information about using segments for cross-device visitor identification, see [Create Segments](/help/implement/js-implementation/xdevice-visid/segments.md).
