# Audience Analytics use cases

## Ad Sales and Content Decisions {#section_A7A001BCC6874961A8B0A70503D6B00D}

As a Media Publisher, you can provide not only size but audience effectiveness metrics to your ad sales team. You can also determine what content resonates best with specific demographic segments, like "Women in their 30s who are 1st-time moms."

## Re-Targeting Opportunities {#section_29C46BA00B3D43CE8A433EA64072D952}

As a Travel Company, you can quickly overlay destination preferences with purchase behavior to see which audiences have a higher propensity to book. You can then re-target these audiences.

## Look-Alike Modeling {#section_E2E2DD1495BC4FE9A3E26541962BFF3F}

As a Multi-Media Publisher, you can compare your 3rd-party audiences using [Segment IQ](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/analysis-workspace/segment-comparison.html) to understand key differentiating characteristics. This helps you build high-value 1st-party segments to then use for targeting.

## Prospect Analysis {#section_7DB1D045DD3F417CBA48C68E9E81E6C0}

As a B2B Retailer, you can now deeply analyze the behavior of your prospect audience right before they purchase using [sequential segmentation](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/segment/sequence-filters.html), which helps you understand what actions drive conversion.

## Demographic Targeting {#section_F034DB721A06419283DBD29D4A1B444B}

As a Destination Resort, you can use [Histograms in Analysis Workspace](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/analysis-workspace/histogram.html) to see purchases distributed by age. This helps you find the right audience to target for each of your resort properties.
