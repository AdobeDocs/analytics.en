# Select a report suite

You can select a report suite from the drop-down list or select a report suite from a cell and automatically update your data block with a new report suite.

**Select report suite from cell**

Selecting a report suite from a cell makes it easy to refresh data blocks using different report suites. If your organization has multiple report suites that are similar or identical to each other in structure, instead of creating completely new reports with separate data blocks, you can refresh data blocks with a report suite selected from a cell. This is also helpful if you have complicated data block formats that include customized components and layouts.

To select a report suite from a cell, first build a data block and assign multiple report suites to a cell outside of your data block. Then, use the report suite from cell panel to refresh your data blocks from different report suites.

1. Create a data block.
   For information about creating a data block, see [Create a Data Block](/help/report-builder/create-a-data-block.md).

1. Click the *cell icon* in the *report suites* section.

1. Select a cell location to add the report suites to the selected cell.

   You might want to select a cell far enough away from your data block cells so that they don't overlap.

1. Confirm the selected cell location.

1. Select the report suites that you want to assign to the cell.

1. Click **Apply**.

   When you finish your data block, you can refresh your data block using a different report suite from the selected cell.

   **Change the report suite from the cell**

1. Click the report suite cell location that you chose in Step 3.

   A drop-down menu listing the report suites that you selected previously in Step 5 is displayed.

1. Select a different report suite from the drop-down list.

1. (Optional) **Select Refresh data block(s)** upon change.

1. Click **Apply**.

   Report Builder refreshes the data block with the chosen report suite.
