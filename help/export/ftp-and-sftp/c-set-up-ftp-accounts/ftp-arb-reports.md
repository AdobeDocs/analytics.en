# Report Builder delivered reports

Use the Adobe Report Builder add-in for Microsoft Excel to build customized requests from Web analytics data, which you can insert into your Excel worksheets.

Requests can dynamically reference cells within your worksheet, and you can update and customize how the data is presented. For FTP, you must ensure that the host is available externally. For more information on the [!UICONTROL report builder] delivered reports, see [Report Builder Help](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/arb/index.html#ReportBuilder_Home).

For information on FTP limits and data retention, see [FTP Limits and Data Retention](/help/export/ftp-and-sftp/ftp-limits.md).
