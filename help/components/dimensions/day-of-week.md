# Day of week

The 'Day of week' dimension reports the day of the week the hit occurred. This report is valuable if you want a report broken out by week, but do not want a static days as dimension items. It is especially valuable as a dimension in scheduled reports, as this dimension works with any date range.

## Populate this dimension with data

This dimension works out of the box for all implementations. If a report suite contains data, this dimension works.

## Dimension items

Dimension items include `Sunday` - `Saturday`, representing the day of the week that the hit occurred on. The order of dimension items respects the first day of the week in [Customize calendar](/help/admin/admin/c-manage-report-suites/c-edit-report-suites/general/custom-calendar.md) by default.
