# Processing rules for Marketing Channels

Marketing Channel processing rules determine if a visitor hit meets the criteria assigned to a channel. The rules process every hit a visitor makes on your site. When a rule does not meet the criteria for a channel, or if rules are not configured correctly, the system assigns the hit to No Channel Identified.

Here are important guidelines for creating rules:

* Sort the rules in the order that you want them to be processed. 
* At the end of your list, include a catch-all rule, such as Other. This rule identifies external traffic but not internal traffic.

  See [No Channel Identified](/help/components/c-marketing-channels/c-faq.md#section_451E42994DA247A8A7B8559C715A5EE7).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Although these rules do not affect reporting outside of marketing channels, they affect marketing channel data collection. Data collected with these rules are 100% permanent, and rules altered after data is collected is not retroactive. It is strongly recommended to review and consider all circumstances before saving [!UICONTROL Marketing Channel Processing Rules] to mitigate data being collected in incorrect channels.

**Prerequisites**

* Review the conceptual information in [Getting Started with Marketing Channels](/help/components/c-marketing-channels/c-getting-started-mchannel.md) and [About Marketing Channel Reports](/help/components/c-marketing-channels/c-overview.md). 

* Create one or more channels so that you can assign rules to them.

  See [Add marketing channels](/help/components/c-marketing-channels/c-channels.md).
