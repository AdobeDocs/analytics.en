# Approve calculated metrics

In the Calculated metrics manager, you can set up a workflow that includes approving metrics for various levels of application and for specific departments or groups.

To mark calculated metrics as approved:

1. In Adobe Analytics, select [!UICONTROL **Components**] > [!UICONTROL **Calculated metrics**] to go to the Calculated metrics manager.

1. In the Calculated metrics manager, select the checkbox to the left of any metrics that you want to mark as approved.

1.  Select **[!UICONTROL Approve]** in the management task at the top of the page.

   To remove a metric from the list of approved metrics, select **[!UICONTROL Unapprove]**.

1.  (Optional) Share the metric with other users in your organization, as described in [Share calculated metrics](/help/components/c-calcmetrics/c-workflow/cm-workflow/cm-sharing.md).

1.  Select **[!UICONTROL OK]**.

   Notice the approval icon next to the calculated metric in the list:  ![](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_CheckmarkCircle_18_N.svg)
