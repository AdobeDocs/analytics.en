# Visitor Zip and Postal Codes

Shows the zip and postal codes that produced the customers that had the greatest effect on success metrics. The information for this report is typically obtained during the purchase process, when you know the ZIP or postal code from which the purchase is being made. You can use this report to determine the success of a localized advertising campaign down to a specific town or city.

This report is populated in one of two ways:

*   Populating the `s.zip` variable in your Analytics Implementation
*   Configuring automatic zip population based on geoSegmentation data. You can configure zip to be populated only when s.zip is not set. To enable, have a supported user contact Adobe Customer Care.

See [GeoSegmentation Regions and Postal Code usage by Country](reports-geosegmentation-reference.md)
