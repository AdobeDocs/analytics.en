# Media Playback Time Spent panel

In Analysis Workspace, Playback Time Spent is the amount of time spent viewing your media streams at a specific point in time. It includes pause, buffer, and time to start.

The Media Playback Time Spent panel enables analysis of playback over time, with details on peak concurrency and the ability to break down and compare. 

Media Analytics customers can analyze playback time spent to gain valuable insight into the quality of content and viewer engagement, and to help when troubleshooting or planning for volume or scale.

Playback Time Spent can help you understand:

* Where peak concurrency occurred

* Where drop-offs occurred
