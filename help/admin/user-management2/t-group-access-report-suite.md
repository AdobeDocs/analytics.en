# Assign user groups to a report suite

Steps that describe how to assign user groups to a report suite.

The [!UICONTROL Report Suites] page lets you view and configure company report suites. Analytics manages report suite access through group membership. For first-time setup, create the needed groups (assigning report suites to each group), then assign user accounts to the appropriate [groups](../user-management2/c-user-groups/groups.md#concept_6C565553DCE3417C909234B2F044A02F) 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL User Management]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Report Suites]**.
1. Select a report suite.
1. Under **[!UICONTROL Report Suite Permissions Management]** page, select the groups to assign to the report suite:

   **[!UICONTROL Available Groups:]**Displays all currently defined groups. Select the desired groups, then click **[!UICONTROL Add]**. The assigned groups appear in the Group Containing field (on the right).

   **[!UICONTROL Group Containing:]** Displays all groups currently assigned to the report suite. To remove a group, select it, then click **[!UICONTROL Remove]**. 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Changes]**.
