# New Adobe Analytics landing page

The new landing page for Adobe Analytics brings together both Analysis Workspace and Reports & Analytics in a single interface and access point under the Workspace umbrella. It features a new project manager home page, an updated reports menu, modernized reports, and a new learning section to help you with getting started more effectively.

The new page improves discoverability and guides Reports & Analytics users to an improved reporting experience in Workspace.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This landing page will be in Open Beta starting on July 21, 2021. It is an optional starting point. If you prefer, you may use your existing landing page, whether that is Workspace or Reports. If you do decide to opt in to the beta program, access the page and click **[!UICONTROL Provide feedback]** at the top of the screen to log your feedback and any bugs you may encounter. You can opt out of and back in to the beta program at any time. Any work done in the beta user interface carries over into the existing/current Workspace experience.

## Access the new landing page {#access-landing}

After you log in to Adobe Experience Cloud and Analytics, enable the [!UICONTROL New landing page - Beta] toggle button in the lower left corner. Access to the toggle button is user specific per Organization, not company specific.

![](assets/new-landing.png)

## Notice the new menu structure

The top menu and the left rail have changed.

![](assets/top-menus.png)

* Top Analytics menu changes: The **[!UICONTROL Reports]** top menu is no longer there. Most of the reports are now in the [!UICONTROL Reports] menu in the left rail.
* The left rail has three tabs: [!UICONTROL Projects], [!UICONTROL Reports], and [!UICONTROL Learning]. We discuss each of them in more detail in the following sections.

### Terminology

Note some changes to terminology:

* **[!UICONTROL Projects]** are things that you have built or that someone else has built and shared with you. [!UICONTROL Projects] also refers to blank projects and blank mobile scorecards.
* **[!UICONTROL Reports]** refers to anything that was pre-built by Adobe, such as reports in Reports & Analytics and templates in Workspace. [!UICONTROL Reports] are also report templates that your company has built for you.
* **[!UICONTROL Templates]** is no longer used as a term for Adobe's pre-built Workspace projects. They are now under [!UICONTROL Reports].

## Navigate the [!UICONTROL Projects] tab {#navigate-projects}

[!UICONTROL Projects] serves as the [!UICONTROL Workspace] home page. Any Workspace projects show up here, including Mobile scorecards.

![](assets/new-landing-all.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>Several of the following settings persist (are remembered) both throughout the session and across sessions. Examples: Which tab you are on, which filters were selected, which columns were selected, and the column sort direction. Search results are not persisted, however.

| UI element | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| ... More | Lets you [!UICONTROL View Tutorials], and [Edit user preferences](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/user-preferences.md). |
| Create project | The drop-down menu lets you create a [!UICONTROL Workspace project] or a [!UICONTROL Mobile project]. |
| Show less/more | Toggles between not showing and showing the banner: ![](assets/top-banner.png) |
| Blank project | Creates a blank [Workspace project](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.html?lang=en) for you to populate. |
| Blank mobile scorecard | Creates a blank [mobile scorecard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/mobapp/curator.html?lang=en) for you to populate. |
| Open Training Tutorial | Opens the Workspace training tutorial that guides new users through building a project in a step-by-step fashion.|
| Open release notes | Opens the Adobe Analytics section of the latest Adobe Experience Cloud release notes. |
| Filter icon | You can filter on tags, report suites, owners, types, and other filters (Mine, Shared with me, Favorites, and Approved)  |
| Search bar | The search now includes all columns in the table. |
| Selection box | Clicking this box next to one or more projects displays the project management actions you can perform: Delete, Tag, Pin, Approve, Share, Rename, Copy, and Export to CSV. You may not have permissions to perform all of these actions. |
| Favorites | Favoriting a project puts a star by it and tags it as a favorite that you can filter on.  |
| Name | The name of the project. |
| Pin icon | **New** You can now pin items and they *always* appear at the top of your list. |
| Info (i) icon | Clicking the info icon shows the following info about this project: Type, Project Role, Owner, Description, and who it is shared with. It also indicates who can [edit or duplicate](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/curate-share/share-projects.html) this project. |
| Ellipsis (...) | Clicking the ellipsis next to a project displays the project management actions you can perform: Delete, Tag, Pin, Approve, Share, Rename, Copy, and Export to CSV. Note that you may not have permissions to perform all of these actions. |
| Type | Indicates whether this type is a Workspace project or a Mobile scorecard. |
| Tags | You can tag reports to organize them into groups. |
| Project Role | Project roles refer to whether you are the project Owner, and whether you have permissions to Edit or Duplicate the project.  |
| Report Suite | Tables and visualizations within a panel derive data from the report suite selected in the top right of the panel. The report suite also determines what components are available in the left rail. Within a project, you can use one or many report suites depending on your analysis use cases. The list of report suites is sorted on relevance. Adobe defines relevance based on how recently and frequently the suite has been used by the current user, and how frequently the suite is used within the organization. |
| Owner | The person who created the project. |
| Last opened | When this project was last opened by you. |
| Column selector | If you want to add or remove columns from the list of projects, you can do so by selecting or deselecting them. |
| < (Back button) | This button in a Workspace project or a report takes you back to your most recent landing page configuration. Whatever page configuration you had when you left the landing page will persist when you return. |

## Navigate the [!UICONTROL Reports] tab {#navigate-reports}

The [!UICONTROL Reports] tab consolidates three sets of reports:

* The pre-built [!UICONTROL Workspace] templates that were previously located under [!UICONTROL Workspace] > [!UICONTROL Project] > [!UICONTROL New]. Adobe no longer uses the word "template" in this context.
* Most of the pre-built reports under the previous Adobe Analytics [!UICONTROL Reports] top menu. These reports are now displayed in [Analysis Workspace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.html?lang=en).
* Anything your company has built for you.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Under Reports, a Favorites folder shows up only if you mark a new report as a favorite. No pre-existing Reports & Analytics favorites are carried forward.

![](assets/reports-tab.png)

As previously mentioned, only the most commonly used reports that were formerly grouped in Reports & Analytics are available here. A handful of rarely used or no-longer-relevant reports were not migrated over. See the FAQ below for more detail.

Here are the new menus and their submenus. If you cannot find a specific report, do a "Search on page" to find it.

### Use the Reports tab

For current users of Reports & Analytics, here is a short intro on how to use the reports you are used to and that now display within Workspace. Reports act like existing templates: if you make changes to them, you get prompted to save/discard your changes when navigating away or to a different report. And if you do want to save changes, it saves the report as a new project.

1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Reports] tab.
1. Select the report you want to view, for example, under [!UICONTROL Most popular], select the [!UICONTROL Pages] report.
1. To the right, click **[!UICONTROL Open report]**.

   ![](assets/pages-report.png)

1. The Pages report, as displayed in Analysis Workspace, shows two [visualizations](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-analysis-visualizations.md) ([Bar chart](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/bar.md) and [Summary number](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/summary-number-change.md)) and a [Freeform table](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/freeform-table.md). The metric used is Occurrences.
1. From here, you have multiple options. Here are some of those options:

   * You can use the report as is.
   * You can drag one or more segments into the Segment drop zone at the top. For example, drag the segment [!UICONTROL Mobile Customers] and watch the results change. 
   * You can change the date range by going to the calendar at the top right.
   * You can add dimension breakdowns, drag in other metrics, and generally customize the report in any way you wish.

More learning options:

* Notice that you have access to a 20-minute video overview of Analysis Workspace at the top left of any report you open.
* For new users, we recommend the [Training Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCH1Kl1q9Wk) video that walks you through building a new project.
* Here is a link to the [complete Analysis Workspace documentation](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.md).
* Here is the complete [YouTube playlist for Analysis Workspace](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2tCx83mn7GuNnQdYGOtlyCu0V5mEZ8sS).

## Navigate the Learning tab {#navigate-learning}

The Learning page contains hands-on video tours and tutorials, plus links to documentation.

## Navigate the new page

* The [!UICONTROL Workspace Fundamentals] Tour takes you directly to Workspace and walks you through the Workspace layout and where to find/perform the most common actions. This Tour can also be relaunched any time directly in Workspace via the tool tip pop-over from the panel header.

* Clicking a video/tour adds a **[!UICONTROL Viewed]** tag. This tag helps you track your progress through the learning content. You can click the tag and it disappears, in case you have not completed the content yet.

* The **[!UICONTROL Learn more]** button on the video modal takes you to an Adobe Experience League documentation page with more help content related to the video you just watched.  **[!UICONTROL View more videos]** takes you to the full Analysis Workspace YouTube playlist.
