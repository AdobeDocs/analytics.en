# Calculated metrics manager

The Calculated metrics page offers many ways of curating metrics, such as sharing, filtering, tagging, approving, copying, deleting, and marking as favorites.

The Calculated metrics page shows you all the segments you own and that have been shared with you. Admin-level users can see all custom metrics in the organization.

You can configure the information displayed for each calculated metric in the Calculated metrics manager by configuring the columns that are displayed.

To configure the visible columns in the Calculated metrics manager:

1. In Adobe Analytics, select the **[!UICONTROL Components]** tab, then select **[!UICONTROL Calculated metrics]**. 

1. In the Calculated metrics manager, select the **Customize columns** icon ![Customize columns icon](assets/customize-columns-icon.png), then select the columns that you want to be displayed in the Calculated metrics manager.

   The following columns are available:

   | Column title  | Description |
   |---|---|
   | Favorites  | Displays star icons next to each calculated metric, allowing you to mark calculated metrics as favorites. For more information, see [Mark calculated metrics as favorites](/help/components/c-calcmetrics/c-workflow/cm-workflow/cm-favorite.md). |
   | Title and description | These values are provided in the Calculated metric builder. To edit the title and description, select the title link to open the Calculated metric builder.  |
   | Report suite | Indicates in which report suite the metric was last saved.  |
   | Owner | Indicates who owns the custom metric. As a non-admin, you can see only metrics you own or those that were shared with you.  |
   | Tags | Shows tags that were applied to the metric, either by you or by people who shared the calculated metric with you.  |
   | Shared with | Lists individuals or groups (admin only) or All (admin only) that you shared the calculated metric with. <p>When a calculated metric is being shared, a share icon displays next to the calculated metric name.</p>  |
   | Date modified | Indicates the date when the custom metric was last modified.  |
   | Used in | Shows where calculated metrics are currently being used, and how many times they are being used in each area. <p>For example, if the calculated metric is being used in 40 projects and 2 alerts, then the value of this column shows as [!UICONTROL **42 components**]. <p>Select the value in this column to see the breakdown of where the calculated metrics are being used (for example, [!UICONTROL **Projects (40)**], [!UICONTROL **Alerts (2)**]). Furthermore, you can view the list of items where the calculated metrics are being used. For example, so see the list of projects where they are being used, select the [!UICONTROL **Projects (40)**] link.</p><p>Each of the following areas shows the number of instances of calculated metrics being used in that area:</p> <ul><li>[!UICONTROL **Projects**]<p>Contains calculated metrics that were [created in the calculated metric builder](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/apply-create-metrics.md#create-calculated-metrics-for-all-projects) and are available for all projects.</p></li><li>[!UICONTROL **Ad hoc components**]<p>Contains calculated metrics that were [created as quick calculated metrics ](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/apply-create-metrics.md#create-calculated-metrics-for-a-single-project) and are available only within a single project.</p></li><li>[!UICONTROL **Scheduled projects**]</li><li>[!UICONTROL **Mobile Scorecards**]</li><li>[!UICONTROL **Annotations**]</li><li>[!UICONTROL **Alerts**]</li><li>[!UICONTROL **Report Builder**]<p>Selecting this option downloads a CSV file, with the following columns of data:</p><ul><li>Report Builder Name</li><li>Last accessed</li><li>Last accessed IMS User ID</li><li>Last accessed user name</li></ul><p>When viewing information for Report Builder, usage information is available starting in September 2024.</p></li></ul><p>This information can help you determine whether a component is valuable to users in your organization, where it is used, and if it needs to be deleted or modified.</p><p>Consider the following when viewing this column:</p><ul><li>This information is available only to system administrators.</li><li>The [!UICONTROL **Used in**] column does not display by default.
