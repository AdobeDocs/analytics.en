## March 2023 {#mar23}

| Feature | Description | [Rollout starts](releases.md) | [General Availability](releases.md) |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| **Partial support for Activity Map with Web SDK** | Starting with Web SDK version 2.15.0, we started populating Activity Map data when link tracking is enabled. This allows Web SDK users to get Activity Map reporting if they have link tracking enabled with the Web SDK and Activity Map configured in Analytics.<p>Enabling link tracking with Web SDK currently sends link events when a customer navigates from one page to the next. This is different from how AppMeasurement works and can potentially result in extra billable hits sent to Adobe. Learn more [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/data-collection/track-links.html) and [here](/help/analyze/activity-map/activitymap-getting-started/activitymap-getting-started-admins/activitymap-enable.md)| N/A | March 31, 2023 |
| **Data Dictionary in Analysis Workspace** | The Data Dictionary helps both users and administrators keep track of, manage, and better understand the components (dimensions, metrics) in their Analytics environment. [Learn more](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/data-dictionary/data-dictionary-overview.md) | March 15, 2023 | **Temporarily unavailable** |
| **Data Stories in Mobile Dashboards** | Data stories let you add multiple customizable detail views to tiles in Mobile Scorecard projects. Use data stories to dive deeper into key drivers, related metrics, and different steps along the customer journey. You can easily swipe through these views to understand the whole story behind your key metrics. [Learn more](/help/analyze/mobile-app/create-scorecard.md#create-data-story)  | N/A | March 8, 2023 |
| **Expiration dates for scheduled project** | You can set maximum expiration dates for scheduled projects to up to one year, regardless of schedule frequency. | N/A | March 8, 2023 |
| **Link sharing for projects (no login required)** - Private beta access only | <p>You can now share read-only links to Analysis Workspace projects with people who don't have access to Adobe Analytics. You can share project links with people outside of your organization, or those within your organization who are not provisioned for Adobe Analytics. [Learn more](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/curate-share/share-projects.md)</p> <p>To join the private beta, contact your Adobe Account Team.</p> | April 26, 2023 | June 2023 |
| **Panel date range updates** |  In Workspace, we added the following improvements:<ul><li>Starting with the February release, dimension items and data previews are based on the panel date range and not the last 90 days. </li><li>All dimension items listed are based on data within the panel date range. If a dimension item has data outside the date range, you can show additional data beyond the date range at the bottom of the list.</li><li>Dimensions that don't have data can be displayed in the left rail. Click the show more options to view dimension items with data outside the panel date range.</li><li>Data previews in the segment and calculated metric builders are based on the panel date range unless accessed from the component managers, which don't have an associated panel and are still based on the last 90 days.</li><li>Data previews display data or components based on the panel date range.</li></ul>| N/A | February 8, 2023 |

### Important notices for Adobe Analytics administrators {#admin}

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **Device lookup processes now use a third party for all device lookups** | March 3, 2023 |On March 2, 2023, as part of the support rollout for client hints, we updated our device lookup processes to use a third party for all device lookups. Previously, we had used the third party only for mobile device lookups. As part of that rollout, some desktop operating systems were incorrectly labelled with the text "mobile" (e.g. "Mobile OS X 10.15.7" instead of "OS X 10.15.7 ").<p>During Adobe's April release we will correct these names. Analytics and CJA reporting will be updated retroactively, since their reporting looks up operating system name based on an ID which is recorded as part of the event data. Once the lookup value corresponding to an ID is updated, all reporting will be corrected, including historical data. For [!UICONTROL Data Feeds] customers, the change are retroactive if you are using a similar lookup process at the time of reporting. However, if you store the operating system value in your event data, reporting will be updated going forward only. See [Operating System](/help/components/dimensions/operating-systems.md) for more details. |
| **Update to device lookups due to Google Client Hints** | February 27, 2023 | The use of client hints, planned for February 16, 2023, was postponed in order to better ensure the quality of device lookups using hints. We proceeded with the first phase of the release for support of Client Hints on February 27, 2023. The second and final phase of the release was completed on Thursday, March 2, 2023. [Learn more](/help/technotes/client-hints.md)|
| **Analytics Source Connector availability** | February 15, 2023 | On February 28, 2023, the Analytics Source Connector was made available in the new Adobe Experience Platform data center located in Canada. |
| **Automatic migration to Classification Set architecture** | February 8, 2023 | Over the next several months, Adobe plans to migrate all classifications across all organizations to the latest classification architecture. The last customers to migrate is estimated to happen in May 2023. No customer action is required, and no down time is expected. This new architecture has many benefits, including:<ul><li>Significantly reduced processing time (72 hours â†’ 24 hours)</li><li>The ability to use the [Classification Sets](/help/components/classifications/sets/overview.md) UI</li><li>The option to use classification data in Adobe Experience Platform in the future through the [Adobe Analytics source connector for classification data](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sources/connectors/adobe-applications/classifications.html)</li></ul>Note the following changes that can potentially impact your organization's workflow:<ul><li>When using the browser or FTP import, '[!UICONTROL Overwrite on conflict]' is always enabled.</li><li>When using the browser or FTP import, the option to export immediately after import is no longer supported.</li><li>The Analytics 2.0 API `GetDimensions` endpoint now returns string identifiers for classifications instead of numeric identifiers. Numeric identifiers can still be used, but Adobe recommends using the new string identifiers where possible. Numeric identifiers can be retrieved by using the `?expansion=hidden` query string parameter.</li></ul>Contact Adobe Customer Care if you want a more specific migration schedule for your organization, or have questions/concerns around this migration.

We apologize for the inconvenience, but we ask that you uninstall or disable the modules that are installed on your Apache server. See pages 27 and 28 in [this document](/help/release-notes/mod_ktrackforSiteCatalyst_ver1.40.pdf) for reference. |
| **EOL for [!DNL Reports & Analytics]** | March 7, 2023 | Effective **December 31, 2023**, Adobe intends to discontinue [!DNL Reports & Analytics] and its accompanying reports and features.

Most [!DNL Reports & Analytics] features are available in [Analysis Workspace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.html). Since the release of Analysis Workspace in 2015, [!DNL Reports & Analytics] functionality and capabilities have been moved to Analysis Workspace and a threshold of workflow parity has been reached. [This notice](https://spark.adobe.com/page/6WnF8JK6IRDhf/) explains the end-of-life process.<p>On December 31, 2023, we will terminate many of the associated Reports & Analytics features, including, but not limited to: Scheduled Reports, Data Extracts, and DL Reports. After Dec 31, 2023, any scheduled reports will no longer be sent. In **April 2023**, any reports that were scheduled to expire beyond Dec 31, 2023, will automatically be updated and reverted to expire on Dec 31, 2023.

| **Update to device lookups due to Google Client Hints** | January 25, 2023 | The use of client hints in device lookup will start on **February 16, 2023**. <p> <p>As of October 2022, it is possible to collect client hints with either the Web SDK or AppMeasurement JavaScript libraries. But client hints will not be incorporated into device lookup until February 2023. At that time, Adobe will begin using client hints in addition to the User-Agent when deriving certain device information for hits coming from Chromium browsers, such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. This is in response to Google's plan to gradually reduce the information presented from the User-Agent string in lieu of data passed via client hints. <p> <p>As part of this change, Adobe will use Device Atlas for all device lookups related to User-Agent. [Learn more](/help/technotes/client-hints.md)|

| **Pausing scheduled tasks in Report Builder** | January 6, 2023 | On **January 31, 2023**, Adobe will roll out changes to scheduled tasks in Report Builder as part of our performance and delivery optimization efforts. These changes include removing the ability to have scheduled deliveries "end after x occurrences."<p>You can continue to schedule hourly Report Builder tasks and have them end after a maximum of 99 occurrences. Please note that the rollback only applies to hourly tasks; the "end after x occurrences" will remain unavailable for all other delivery intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly). Please note that this option will be deprecated on January 31, 2023. For more questions or support, please reach out to Adobe Customer Care.

| **Improved IP-to-geolocation mapping** | January 4, 2023 | Our vendor for IP lookups, Digital Element, is upgrading to a new improved dataset (NetAcuity Pulse) for IP-to-geolocation mapping. Originally planned for October 2022, Adobe Analytics will adopt this new dataset on **January 11, 2023**. The new database will be more accurate than previous versions. Some IP-to-geo mappings will change/improve when the new database is adopted.<p>All Adobe Analytics tools (Analysis Workspace, Reports & Analytics, Reporting API, Data Warehouse, LiveStream, Analytics Data Feeds, and so on) will automatically take advantage of the new improved mappings. There will be no change in the format of the data in data feeds. CJA data provided through the Analytics Source Connector will automatically take advantage of the new mappings. |
| **Update to new NetAcuity carrier database** | January 4, 2023 | This update, originally planned for on October 5, 2022, will now happen on **January 11, 2023**. Carrier-related information stored in the `carrier` field in Adobe Analytics Data Warehouse and Analytics Data Feeds will change. Historically, the data format in that column has been `<domain>:<ISP>`. Adobe has maintained an internal lookup table to map these `<domain>:<ISP>` values into carrier names for reporting purposes in Adobe Analytics reporting tools (Analysis Workspace, Reports & Analytics, Reporting API, Data Warehouse, LiveStream, etc.). The lookup file (`carrier.tsv`) is also provided with Data Feeds so that you can use the same mappings.<p>This update enhances our carrier mappings by using a more accurate carrier database from NetAcuity. The format of the data in the carrier column in Data Feeds will change going forward. Instead of `<domain>:<ISP>`, it will contain a carrier name. Adobe will continue to use the lookup table in order to maintain as much continuity with past reporting as possible. Reporting tools where the lookups are applied by Adobe (Analysis Workspace, Reports & Analytics, reporting API, data warehouse, LiveStream, etc.) will benefit from more accurate mappings. Some mappings â€“ especially for international domains and ISPs â€“ will change more than others when Adobe adopts the new database. The data feeds carrier lookup file (`carrier.tsv`) will maintain the old mappings and add the new mappings.<p>The Analytics Source Connector does not currently map the carrier field, so carrier reporting is not currently available in Experience Platform, CJA, and so on. Therefore, use of the new carrier database will not impact anything in Experience Platform that is based on data provided by the Analytics Source Connector. |
| **Updated guidelines for traffic spike notifications** | November 18, 2022 | Former guidelines were based strictly on hit volumes. The [new guidelines](/help/admin/admin/c-manage-report-suites/c-edit-report-suites/c-traffic-management/t-traffic-schedule-spike.md) are based on a combination of report suite size and percent increase. |
