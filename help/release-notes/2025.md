| **Analytics inventory** | Analytics Inventory provides a comprehensive overview of your Adobe Analytics environment, including the number of projects and components, report suites, users, and more. By automating the inventory process, you can quickly understand the effort needed to switch from Adobe Analytics to Customer Journey Analytics. This will make the transition easier and faster. [Learn more](/help/admin/tools/analytics-inventory.md)|  | March 26, 2025 |
| **Update to Analytics context data field `a.locale`** | This update changes how the Analytics context data field `a.locale` is set when collecting data via Experience Edge. When data is sent to Adobe Analytics using Experience Edge, Analytics fields are populated based on a mapping of XDM fields. The mapping for `c.a.locale` references a non-standard XDM field, `xdm.environment.language`. This field will be updated to reference the correct field, `xdm.environment._dc.language`.<p>The mapping will continue to reference `xdm.environment.language` for backwards compatibility. For continuity, if both fields are set, `xdm.environment.language` takes precedence. You can view the full list of mappings from XDM to standard Analytics fields [here](/help/implement/aep-edge/xdm-var-mapping.md).  | | March 5, 2025 |
| **Customer Journey Analytics upgrade guide** | Lets you generate a step-by-step guide for upgrading from Adobe Analytics to Customer Journey Analytics. This guide is tailored to your organization and takes into consideration your current Adobe Analytics environment, your intended uses for Customer Journey Analytics, and any time-saving tradeoffs your organization wants to make.<p>To start generating your custom guide, log in to [!DNL Customer Journey Analytics], then select **[!UICONTROL Upgrade to Customer Journey Analytics]** on the **[!UICONTROL Workspace]** tab.<p>[Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/compare-aa-cja/upgrade-to-cja/cja-upgrade-recommendations#recommended-upgrade-steps-for-most-organizations) |  | March 11, 2025 |
| **Data Warehouse-only dimensions** | Starting in May 2025, Adobe will begin setting certain dimensions (custom variables such as eVars and props) as 'Data Warehouse-only". This will apply to dimensions that exhibit the following characteristics:<ul><li> Over a period of multiple months, the variable hits the low traffic limit within the first few days of the month.</li><li>> 90% of the values passed in are seen only once during the month.</li></ul>Examples include dimensions containing timestamps, UUIDs or other data which have extremely high cardinality and where unique new values are passed into for almost every hit (or visit or visitor) throughout the month.These dimensions usually exceed the low-traffic limits very quickly and only a very small portion of the values are reportable in Analysis Workspace. This makes reports utilizing these dimensions confusing, since they do not show useful or accurate information. These dimensions do not follow the purpose of or benefit from the low-traffic functionality, which is intended to provide a way to do reporting on values that become 'popular' after the dimension has exceeded the low-traffic limits during the month. [Learn more](/help/technotes/low-traffic.md)<p>Dimensions marked as "Data Warehouse-only" will not be available for reporting in Analysis Workspace. However, they will still be available for reporting through Data Warehouse, because low-traffic limits do not apply here.<p>This does not mean that every dimension that has hit the low-traffic limits is a candidate to be marked as "Data Warehouse-only". Most dimensions that hit the low-traffic limits actually meet the intention of low-traffic functionality:<ul><li>Most values passed in are not unique.</li><li>Common values continue to come in after the low-traffic limits have been reached during the month.</li><li>New 'popular' values can still occur.</li></ul>It is only the dimensions where almost all values passed in are new and unique that will be marked as "Data Warehouse-only". Increasing the low-traffic limits is not a solution given the uniqueness of the data being collected in these situations. | | May 2025 |
