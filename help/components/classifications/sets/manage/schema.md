# Classification set schema

The schema is the list of classifications that you want to apply to the key dimensions you have defined for the classification set. For example, if you have defined product as the key dimension, and this field contains a product SKU, then you use the schema to add classifications like product name, product color, product size, and more.

To define the schema for a classification set:

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Classifications Sets]** manager, select the classification set for which you want to edit the schema.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Classification Set: _classification set_]** dialog, select the Schema tab. That tab consists of the following interface elements:

   ![Classification sets - schema](assets/classification-sets-schema.png)

   * [Classification list](#classification-list)
   * [Search](#search)
   * [Actions](#actions)
   * [Action bar](#action-bar)

## Classification list

The list of classifications has the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **[!UICONTROL Classification Name]** | The name you provided for the classification. |
| **[!UICONTROL Identity Name]** | The derived name by the system for the classification. |
| **[!UICONTROL Classified By]** | If used, a link to the lookup classification set that is used to classify this classification. |


## Search

You can quickly search ![Search](/help/assets/icons/Search.svg) for one or more classifications. Use ![CrossSize100](/help/assets/icons/CrossSize100.svg) to clear the search.

## Actions

The following actions are available as buttons on the top of the classifications list:

| Icon | Action | Description | 
|---|---|---|
| ![Add](/help/assets/icons/Add.svg) | **[!UICONTROL Add]** | [Add a classification](#add) to the list. |

   When no classification is defined in the classification set for a column, an alert ![Alert](/help/assets/icons/Alert.svg) is shown. The alert explains that a classification is not present in the existing classification schema set and will be created on import. 

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Overwrite data on conflict?]** if you want to overwrite the current classification data with the new imported. For example:
   
   | | Key | Current Product Color | Import file | New Product Color |
