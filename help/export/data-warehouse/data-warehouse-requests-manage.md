# Manage Data Warehouse requests

The Request Manager lets you view, duplicate, and re-prioritize requests.

In Data Warehouse, select the **[!UICONTROL Request Manager]** tab.

Working in this tab lets you

* View recent report requests by report name, segment applied, requestor, request date and status.
* Duplicate requests. Click **[!UICONTROL Duplicate]** next to the request.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >This action duplicates only the request, not the schedule or the delivery details.

* Search for reports by report name or by the login name of the requestor.
* Re-prioritize reports by dragging and dropping them to a new location within the queue.
* To see when a request started processing, click on a scheduled request ID and examine the pop-up that opens.

> [!NOTE] To cancel a Data Warehouse request, [follow these steps](https://helpx.adobe.com/analytics/kb/cancel-data-warehouse-requests.html).
