# Anomaly Detection

Anomaly Detection provides a statistical method to determine how a given metric has changed in relation to previous data.

As of April 12, 2018, the Anomaly Detection feature has been removed from Reports & Analytics and is available exclusively in [Analysis Workspace](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/analysis-workspace/virtual-analyst.html).
