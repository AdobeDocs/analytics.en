# Scheduled projects

Scheduled Analysis Workspace projects can be managed under **Analytics > Components > Scheduled Projects**.

When managing scheduled projects, you can edit and delete recurring project schedules. Search for a schedule in the search bar or by using the filter options in the left rail. You can filter by [!UICONTROL Tags], [!UICONTROL Owners], [!UICONTROL Favorites], and more.
