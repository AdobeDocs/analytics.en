# Custom Metrics

Custom metrics let you track additional success metrics on your site.

Custom metrics are captured using the [events](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/implement/events#.html) variable, and are available as one of two types:

* Events that count the number of times something occurs. Ad displays, checkouts, and similar events are tracked using this type of event.
* Events that store values that are often used for additional calculation. These events store numerical values, such as currency, that can be used to perform calculations in your report. For example, you might store the shipping cost for the purchase in a custom event. This lets you compare the amount collected for shipping with the actual cost paid to your shipping provider.
