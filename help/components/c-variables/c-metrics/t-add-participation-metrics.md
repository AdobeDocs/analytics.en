# Add Participation metrics

Steps that describe how to add participation metrics.

Participation has to be [enabled](../../../components/c-variables/c-metrics/metrics-participation.md#concept_8E6B39106A244CB49E055150B291B477) for events (1-100) in the Admin Tools before you can add them to a report.

You can also create participation metrics in the [Calculated Metrics](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/calcmetrics/participation_metric.html) builder. 

1. Log in and navigate to any conversion report or traffic report on which you requested participation metrics.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Metrics]**.
1. Under the **[!UICONTROL Metric Type]** menu, select **[!UICONTROL Participation]**.
1. Drag the desired participation metrics to the columns canvas, then click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.

   The resulting report displays participation metrics with a percentage and a number in parenthesis.

* **Percentage**: The proportion of conversion events in which each value participated. 
* **Number in parenthesis**: The actual number of times this value participated prior to the conversion event.
