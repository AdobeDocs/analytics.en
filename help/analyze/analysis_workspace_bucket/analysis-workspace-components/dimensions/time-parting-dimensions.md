# Time-parting dimensions

Time-parting dimensions are based on the time zone of the report suite or virtual report suite. These dimensions are available in Analysis Workspace and can help to answer the following questions: 

* Across a large date range, what is the most popular time of day for visitors to access my site or app?
* Are there days of the week, or hours of the day, on which conversion is higher on my site or app?
* How do my weekend sales compare to my weekday sales?
* Does a certain marketing campaign generate higher conversions in the morning, or in the afternoon?
