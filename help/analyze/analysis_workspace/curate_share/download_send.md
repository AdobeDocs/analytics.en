# Download PDF or CSV files

You can download saved and unsaved projects in PDF and CSV formats.

The name of the PDF or CSV file matches the current name of the project. For unsaved projects, the downloaded file includes the unsaved changes in the project. Note that you cannot schedule unsaved projects in PDF or CSV.

>When we render a project to PDF, we just render what is on the page. If a project has custom-sized visualizations and panels, you need to change them to be auto-sized (button in top-right corner) so that there will be no truncated content.
