# Open a field viewer

Information about opening a field viewer for a log source, transformation, or extended dimension.

* Right-click the appropriate node and click **[!UICONTROL View Fields]**. For extended dimensions, click **[!UICONTROL View Input Fields]**.

  The callout that appears contains a field viewer, which is a table showing all of the fields that are either inputs or outputs of that component. (Inputs and outputs can be fields or dimensions.) For a log source or transformation, the field viewer shows its inputs and outputs. For a dimension, the field viewer shows its inputs. See [Field Viewers](../../../../data-workbench-client/c-admin-intrf/c-dataset-mgrs/c-fld-vwrs/c-fld-vwrs.md#concept_194CB94501564145AE059E53C0E4BEC3).

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >To open a field viewer, your Data Workbench computer must have network access to the Data Workbench server on which the dataset resides. If your dataset resides on a Data Workbench server cluster, your Data Workbench computer must have network access to the master Data Workbench server in the cluster.
