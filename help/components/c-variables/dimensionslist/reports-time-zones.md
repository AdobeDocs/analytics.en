# Time Zones

Displays the time zones from which your visitors are coming. The graph shows a map of the world. If you received visitors from a particular time zone, a colored column appears in that time zone, reflecting the number of visitors you received in the given time period. All time zones are present in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), which is the international time standard.

You can use this dimension to:

**How Roll-up Report Suites Display Time Zones**

Roll-up report suites roll up data for child report suites with different time zones. The roll-up report suite is set for a single time zone, and transposes the relative corresponding time zones for each child report suite. For example, if the roll-up report suite shows 7:00 p.m., and three child report suites were included, each set to Eastern Standard Time (EST), Mountain Standard Time (MST), and Pacific Standard Time (PST), the roll-up would show page views that occurred at 7:00 p.m. in the respective time zones.
