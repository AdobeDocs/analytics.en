The People metric is an Adobe Analytics reporting metric that helps you attribute devices to people.

 It provides a people-based view of marketing, letting you measure visitors' activity across all of their devices. Think of it as a de-duplicated version of Unique Visitors, and you can use the People metric for analysis where you previously used Unique Visitors.

More information on the People metric is available in the [Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcdc/mcdc-people.html) documentation.
