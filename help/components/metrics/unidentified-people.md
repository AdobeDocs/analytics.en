# Unidentified People

The 'Unidentified People' metric is a [Cross-Device analytics](../cda/overview.md) metric that counts the number of visitors that CDA could not identify.

## How this metric is calculated

If a visitor remains unknown to the stitching service (there are hits coming from a device that could not be attributed to a specific person), then this metric increases.
