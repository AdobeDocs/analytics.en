## Important notices for Adobe Analytics administrators {#admin}

| **37-month expiration of Purchase IDs and Event IDs (event serialization)**  | July 10,2023 | An upcoming release of the Analytics Hit processing engine, targeted for release on **July 13, 2023**, will start enforcing a 37-month expiration of Purchase IDs and Event IDs (event serialization). Currently, Purchase IDs and Event IDs never expire in Adobe Analytics. Once a Purchase ID or Event ID is seen/used, then any future hit, no matter when, will have that purchase or event marked as a duplicate. With the new processing engine release:<ul><li>Purchase IDs and Event IDs always expire after 37 months.</li><li>If it has been 37 months since the Purchase ID or Event ID was seen, it is no longer considered a duplicate purchase or event.</li><li> If you are "reusing" Purchase IDs or Event IDs from more than 37 months ago, they are no longer considered duplicates.</li></ul> |
| **Migration to Adobe I/O OAuth Server-to-Server credentials** | May 11, 2023 | Adobe Analytics API and Livestream customers using Adobe I/O JWT credentials must migrate to Adobe I/O OAuth Server-to-Server credentials by **January 1, 2025**.
