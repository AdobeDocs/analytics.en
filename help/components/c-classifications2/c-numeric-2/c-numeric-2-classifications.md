# Numeric 2 classifications overview

Numeric 2 classifications provide custom, flexible metrics that you can import into the Adobe Experience Cloud via the importer.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The ability to import Numeric 2 and Date-Enabled classifications has been removed from the codebase. This change will take effect with the July 2019 Maintenance Release. If you have Numeric or Date-Enabled columns in your import file, those cells will be silently ignored, and any other data within that file will be imported as normal. Existing classifications can still be exported through the standard classification workflow, and will continue to be available in reporting.

> [!NOTE] In the May 10, 2018, Analytics Maintenance release, Adobe started to limit the functionality of date-enabled and numeric classifications. These classification types were removed from the Admin and Classification Importer interfaces. No new date-enabled and numeric classifications can be added. Existing classifications can still be managed (uploaded to, deleted) through the standard classification workflow, and will continue to be available in reporting.

A common way to use numeric 2 classifications is for numeric variables that change over time for different items, such as the cost of goods sold. In admin, you can create classifications on the [!UICONTROL Conversion Classification] page, and then use the importer to export a file, make edits, and then import the file back in to Adobe. After importing the data, you can use the numeric classifications when creating calculated metrics.

>Analysis Workspace and Ad Hoc Analysis do not support Numeric 2 classifications.
