# Visits

Displays the number of visits made to your entire website during a specified time period.

 **Report Properties**

* A visit is defined as a sequence of consecutive page views without a 30 minute break, or continuous activity for 12 hours.
* After a visit expires, a new visit is started on any subsequent image request.
* A visitor typically contains at least one (but probably more than one) visit.
* The beginning of a visit is the first image request coming from a new visitor, or after an existing user's visit has expired. This can be identified as the Entry Page.
* The end of a visit is the last image request before a visit expires. This can be identified as the Exit Page.

  See [Entries and Exits Reports](/help/components/c-variables/dimensionslist/reports-entries-exits.md).
* Hourly breakdowns are based on the report suite's time zone.
* This report does not contain line items. You view it only in the trended format.
* Granularity of hour, day, week, month, quarter, and year can be applied. These granularity settings are available depending on the reporting date range.

See [Visit Metric](/help/components/c-variables/c-metrics/metrics-visit.md) for more information about how the Experience Cloud processes this metric.
