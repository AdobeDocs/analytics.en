# Visits

Analytics counts a visit each time a server call occurs with a Visit Page Number equal to 1.

 If you look at the [previous table](../../js_implementation/xdevice_visid/visit_example.md#concept_E3B32B8E539F4FDC8E3FA872328B87BA), this occurred 4 times: at hits 1, 9, 11, and 12. Similar to visitors, this value returns to normal after the initial association because the [!UICONTROL Visit Page Number] is reset back to 1 due to a change in the effective [!UICONTROL visitor ID].
