# Compare implementation methods

See how each method of implementing Adobe Analytics compares to each other. You can use these tables to help your organization determine the most ideal way to send data to Adobe. Click on each column for more specific information.

| Implementation requirements | Reference `AppMeasurement.js` on each page, define variables, send data using `s.t()` to Adobe Analytics | Reference tag loader on each page, use the Data Collection UI to define variables and send data to Adobe Analytics | Reference `Alloy.js` on each page, use `alloy("sendEvent",{})` to compose XDM objects and send the desired data using Edge Network to Adobe Analytics | Reference tag loader on each page, use the Data Collection UI to compose XDM objects and send the desired data using Edge Network to Adobe Analytics |
| Data destination | Sent directly to Adobe Analytics | Sent directly to Adobe Analytics | Sent to Adobe Experience Platform Edge, which forwards data to Adobe Analytics | Sent to Adobe Experience Platform Edge, which forwards data to Adobe Analytics |
| Difficulty making implementation adjustments | Requires access to website code for every implementation change | Change the website code once to install the loader tag; all further implementation updates can be made in the Data Collection UI | Requires access to website code for every implementation change | Change the website code once to install the loader tag; all further implementation updates can be made in the Data Collection UI |

| Context Data | Use `s.contextData`. | Use `s.contextData` in custom code blocks | All unmapped fields are automatically sent as `a.x.*` context data variables. | All unmapped fields are automatically sent as `a.x.*` context data variables. |
