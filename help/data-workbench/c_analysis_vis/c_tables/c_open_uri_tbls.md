# Open a URI from a table

Open functionality is currently configured only in the Site application and only for opening URIs.

See [Configuring Open Functionality](../../c_intf_anlys_ftrs/c_config_open_funct.md#concept_854E6DC8BEF34E6AA4CCFB7A8929AF4D).

In [!UICONTROL Site], from a URI table, you can right-click a URI to display a web page in a web browser. To view a URI in its native format (such as HTML), Data Workbench must have access to the referenced location and the application needed to open that item. For example, to view a web page, Data Workbench must have access to the Internet as well as have a web browser installed.

* Right-click an element of the dimension and click **[!UICONTROL Open URI]**.

  The URI opens in its native application.
