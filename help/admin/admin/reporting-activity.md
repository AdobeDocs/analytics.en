# Reporting Activity Manager

The Reporting Activity Manager provides you as an Admin with detailed visibility into reporting consumption and helps you easily diagnose capacity issues during peak reporting times. When your organization reaches reporting request capacity and experiences a degradation in reporting performance, you now have a way to self diagnose reporting issues without intervention from Adobe customer care or engineering. You can easily manage reporting queues within a single interface and immediately act​​ to improve your users' experience. This tool

* Informs you about your current reporting capacity  across your report suites.
* Detailed report query information on current reporting requests, whether queued and in progress.
* Lets you cancel specific reporting requests to free up capacity.
