## Administrators

Analytics administrators are responsible for choosing the implementation method most appropriate for their organization.

After Adobe Analytics is implemented, administrators need to perform various configuration tasks to ensure that analysts and end users are getting the full value from Adobe Analytics.

### Implement Adobe Analytics

Various implementation methods are available when implementing Adobe Analytics on your website or mobile app. 

For information about each available method to determine which is right for your organization, see [Implement Adobe Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/home.html).

* Helping [end users](#end-users) (non-analysts) in their organizations understand the data that is gathered

### Understand the interface for analyst features

## End users

You don't have to be a data analyst to gain actionable insights from Adobe Analytics.

### Build projects in Analysis Workspace


### Understand the Analysis Workspace interface

Some users might find it helpful to work with a data analyst to set up a project in Analysis Workspace and explain how to interpret the data; other users might be comfortable building the project and interpreting the data themselves. 


## Go further with Customer Journey Analytics

Customer Journey Analytics is Adobe's next-generation Analytics solution that lets you use the power of Analysis Workspace with data from Adobe Experience Platform. It can break down, filter, query, and visualize years' worth of data, and is combined with Platform's ability to hold all kinds of data schemas and types. 

Following are some of the advantages of Customer Journey Analytics over Adobe Analytics:

* **Unlimited variables and events**: The concepts of eVars, props, and events no longer exist. Data is primarily focused on dimensions and metrics. Datasets can have an unlimited number of unique dimensions and metrics.

* **Unlimited unique values**: Adobe Experience Platform is not constrained to any unique limitations.

* **Alter historical data**: Using Adobe Experience Platform, data can be removed or corrected.

* **Cross-report-suite data**: Existing implementations from multiple datasets can be combined in Platform.

For more information, see [Customer Journey Analytics overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-overview/cja-overview.html?lang=en).
