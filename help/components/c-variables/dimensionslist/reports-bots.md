# Bots

Displays which spiders and bots have visited your site during a given time period. Traffic that is identified as being generated by a bot (based on bot rules you set up) is not sent to your report suite. Rather, it is collected separately. The report displays the pages that these agents have visited.

 Bots are filtered based on the user agent or IP address. We provide the option to use the IAB/ABCe International Spiders & Bots List to filter bot traffic.
