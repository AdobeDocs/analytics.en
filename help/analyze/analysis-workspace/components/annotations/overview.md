# Annotations overview

Annotations enable you to effectively communicate contextual data nuances and insights to your organization. Annotations let you tie calendar events to specific dimensions/metrics. You can graphically display events and see whether campaigns or other events have affected your site traffic, revenue, or any other metric. Formerly referred to as [!UICONTROL Calendar events] in [!DNL Reports & Analytics], you can annotate a date for data issues, public holidays, campaign launches, etc.

## Visibility

Annotations are visible in a variety of ways:
