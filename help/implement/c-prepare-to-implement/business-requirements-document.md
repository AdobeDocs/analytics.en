# Business Requirements document

The Business Requirements Document (BRD) is used to document the key business objectives and requirements.

Consulting will work with you to compile the BRD. The contents of this document depend on a number of factors, such as the nature of your site or application, and your business vertical (such as retail, media, travel, or lead gen).

Consulting will also work with you to compile a Solution Design Reference (SDR), which documents the solution architecture, and a validation checklist to validate the implementation.
