# Summary Number and Summary Change

## Summary Number visualization

* Selects the total of the column if no cell is selected.
* If a single cell is selected, it shows the summary for that cell.
* If more than one cell is selected, it shows the first cell selected.
* If the column is selected, it picks the first cell value in the column.

## Summary Change visualization

* If no cell is selected, it compares the first two cell values in the column.
* If one cell is selected, it shows 0, because it compares the cell value to itself.
* If two cells are selected, the first selected cell is taken as numerator and the second as denominator.
* If more than two cells are selected, it only considers the first two for comparison.
* If a range of cells is selected, it compares the first to the last cells selected in the range.
* If the column is selected, it compares the first value to itself, which shows a change of 0.
* The green and red color of the summary change can be controlled through:

    * [Custom event polarity](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/success_event.html).
    * A calculated metric's [Show Upward Trend As](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/calcmetrics/cm_build_metrics.html) option.
