# Move from section to section

If you want to know how visitors move from section to section on your site, you first need to ensure that you are tagging your sections with the channel variable.

With this data in place, you must have pathing enabled on the *`channel`* variable. If a user starts on the home page and moves to the Sports section, then to the News section, this activity shows up in the [!UICONTROL Site Section] path reports. These reports display after pathing is enabled on this variable.
