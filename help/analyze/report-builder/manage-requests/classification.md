# Classifications

Classification breakdowns are used to map analytics reporting data to related properties. Classifications can be used for a variety of purposes but are most commonly used for classifying campaign tracking codes (both internal and external) and product IDs.

 For example, a [!UICONTROL Campaign] report might have a [!UICONTROL Manager] classification and an [!UICONTROL Outlet] classification. These classifications can then be ordered following a certain hierarchy, and each group of report values can be broken down into subgroups.

You access classifications in the same way you access the other reports of a report suite, and the dimensions are displayed as a top-level report within the group. If a report has classifications, a menu subgroup is created to collect the report and all its classifications in the same location. The report displays as the last entry in the list among the classifications.

See [Classifications](/help/components/c-classifications2/c-classifications.md).
