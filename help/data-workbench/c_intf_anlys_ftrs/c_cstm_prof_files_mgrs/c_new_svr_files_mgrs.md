# Create a Server Files Manager

The Server Files Manager displays all of the directories in the Data Workbench server installation directory, including configuration and look-up files.

 You may want to access a portion of the [!UICONTROL Server Files Manager] without having to navigate its entire directory structure or display only a few of the subdirectories to address a particular need. For example, you might want to create a separate [!UICONTROL Server Files Manager] that displays only the Access Control and Users subdirectories, enabling you to manage your users and their access.

Each manager that you create must have a [!DNL .vw] file. You can use the [!DNL Server Files.vw] file as a template.

For more information about the [!UICONTROL Server Files Manager], see [The Server Files Manager](../../c_admin_intrf/c_svr_files_mgr.md#concept_73A0808487C8424285AE7302F53BC5F4).
