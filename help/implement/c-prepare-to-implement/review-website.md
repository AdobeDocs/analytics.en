# Review website or application

A site or application walk-through is a key step in the implementation process, in which you lead your Implementation Consultant through the site and explain the technical factors and business flows.

This step should be carried out whenever there is a requirement for implementation or implementation changes.

* This step happens in the "strategy planning" phase, in the "onboard" process of an engagement lifecycle. 
* This step typically takes place after the kick-off call between your organization and Consulting,
