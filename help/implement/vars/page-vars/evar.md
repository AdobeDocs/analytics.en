# eVar

*This help page describes how to implement eVars. For information on how eVars work as a dimension, see [eVars](/help/components/dimensions/evar.md) in the Components user guide.*

eVars are custom variables that you can use however you'd like. If you have a [solution design document](/help/implement/prepare/solution-design.md), most dimensions specific to your organization end up as eVars. By default, eVars persist beyond the hit they are set on. You can customize their expiration and allocation under [Conversion variables](/help/admin/admin/conversion-var-admin/conversion-var-admin.md) in Report suite settings.

The number of available eVars depends on your contract with Adobe. Up to 250 eVars are available if your contract with Adobe supports it.

## Set up eVars in report suite settings

Before using eVars in your implementation, make sure you configure each eVar in report suite settings. See [Conversion variables](/help/admin/admin/conversion-var-admin/conversion-var-admin.md) in the Admin guide.

## eVars in Adobe Experience Platform Launch

You can set eVars either while configuring the Analytics extension (global variables) or under rules.

1. Log in to [launch.adobe.com](https://launch.adobe.com) using your AdobeID credentials.
2. Click the desired property.
3. Go to the [!UICONTROL Rules] tab, then click the desired rule (or create a rule).
4. Under [!UICONTROL Actions], click an existing [!UICONTROL Adobe Analytics - Set Variables] action or click the '+' icon.
5. Set the [!UICONTROL Extension] dropdown to Adobe Analytics, and the [!UICONTROL Action Type] to [!UICONTROL Set Variables].
6. Locate the [!UICONTROL eVars] section.

You can set an eVar to a value or a data element. You can also copy the value from another Analytics variable.

## s.eVar1 - s.eVar250 in AppMeasurement and Launch custom code editor

Each eVar is a string that contains custom values specific to your organization. Their max length is 255 bytes; values longer than 255 bytes are automatically truncated when sent to Adobe.

```js
s.eVar1 = "Example custom value";
```

## Counter eVars

eVar values typically contain a string value. However, you can configure eVars to instead contain a counter. For example, you would like to count the number of internal searches made before a purchase. Instead of setting a text value, you would use the following syntax:

```js
// Increment a counter eVar by 1
s.eVar1 = "+1";

// Increment a counter eVar by 12.49
s.eVar1 = "+12.49";
```

If more than two decimal places are given, the eVar counter rounds to two decimal places. An eVar counter cannot contain negative numbers.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You must first configure eVars to 'Counter' in the Admin Console before using counter eVars. See [Conversion variables](/help/admin/admin/conversion-var-admin/conversion-var-admin.md) in the Admin guide.
