There are various configuration options available when creating a Data Warehouse request. The following information describes how to configure report options for the request.

For information about how to begin creating a request, as well as links to other important configuration options, see [Create a Data Warehouse request](/help/export/data-warehouse/create-request/t-dw-create-request.md). 

To configure report options for a Data Warehouse request:

1. Begin creating a request in Adobe Analytics by selecting **[!UICONTROL Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Data Warehouse]** > [!UICONTROL **Add**].

   For additional details, see [Create a Data Warehouse request](/help/export/data-warehouse/create-request/t-dw-create-request.md).

1. On the New Data Warehouse request page, select the [!UICONTROL **Report options**] tab.

   ![Report destination tab](assets/dw-report-options.png) <!-- update screenshot to include Sort by metrics -->

1. Complete the following fields:

   |Option | Function | 
   |---------|----------|
   | [!UICONTROL **File name**] | Identifies the report. <p>If any of the following special characters are used in the file name, the request cannot be saved: <code>! " # $ & ' ( ) * + , / : ; > = < ? @ [ ] \ ^ ` {  } \| ~</code> </p><p>The % character can be used only if it is followed by "R", "rsid", or "id", as follows: <code>%R</code>, <code>%rsid</code>, and <code>%id</code>.</p> | 
   | [!UICONTROL **Append report date range to file name**] | Adds the date range to the report file name. <p>For example, if you request data from May 1, 2024 through May 7, 2024, the filename includes the date range of 20240501 - 20240507.</p> |
   | [!UICONTROL **CSV**] | Delivers reports in a CSV file format for viewing data in a spreadsheet. | 
   | [!UICONTROL **Tableau (TDE)**] | Delivers reports in a Tableau Data Extract (TDE) file format, which can be used to visualize data and layer in additional data within Tableau. |
   | [!UICONTROL **Send report as compressed file (ZIP)**] | Delivers reports in a compressed (ZIP) file format. We recommend enabling this option when using email as the [report destination](/help/export/data-warehouse/create-request/dw-request-report-destinations.md). | 
   | [!UICONTROL **Return all rows**] | When enabled, all rows are included in the report. Disable this option to specify the number of rows to include. | 
   | [!UICONTROL **Beginning of report comments**] | Add any comments that you want to be included with the report. Comments appear at the beginning of the report. | 
   | [!UICONTROL **Sort by metrics**] | Provides ranked breakdown reports in Data Warehouse, sorted by descending metric value. Sorting by metric makes Data Warehouse reports easier for you to interpret, and makes these reports easier to compare with other Analytics breakdown reporting views.<p>For more information, see [Sort by metric](/help/export/data-warehouse/sorting-by-metric.md).</p> | 
   | [!UICONTROL **Send a manifest file**] | Includes metadata about the files included in the report.<!-- What kind of metadata is included in the manifest file? --> | 
   | [!UICONTROL **Send a digital signature file**] | Allows report recipients to verify that the file came from Adobe and that it has not been altered. | 
   | [!UICONTROL **Send an empty file when there is not data in the report**] | Sends a report even when the report contains no data. |
