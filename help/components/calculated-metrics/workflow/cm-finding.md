# Find metrics

You can locate metrics in Analysis Workspace in the same way that you locate other types of components.

For information about how to quickly locate components, see [Search, filter, and sort the component list](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/analysis-workspace-components.md#search-filter-and-sort-the-component-list) in [Components overview](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/analysis-workspace-components.md).
