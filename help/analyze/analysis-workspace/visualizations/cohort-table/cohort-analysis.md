# What is cohort analysis?

A *`cohort`* is a group of people sharing common characteristics over a specified period. Cohort analysis is useful, for example, when you want to learn how a cohort engages with a brand. You can easily spot changes in trends, then respond accordingly. (Explanations of cohort analysis are available on the web, such as at [Cohort Analysis 101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_analysis).)

After creating a cohort report, you can curate its components (specific dimensions, metrics, and segments), then share the cohort report with anyone. See [Curate and Share](../../../../analyze/analysis-workspace/curate-share/curate.md#concept_4A9726927E7C44AFA260E2BB2721AFC6)

**Example cohort report**

A cohort report returns visitors. Each data cell shows the raw number of visitors in the cohort who did the action during that time period.

Examples of what you can do with cohort analysis:

* Launch campaigns designed to spur a desired action. 
* Shift marketing budget at exactly the right time in the customer lifecycle. 
* Recognize when to end a trial or an offer, to maximize value. 
* Gain ideas for A/B testing in areas such as pricing, upgrade path, and so on. 
* View a Cohort Analysis report within a Guided Analysis report.
