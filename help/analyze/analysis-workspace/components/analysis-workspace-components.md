# Components overview

Components in Analysis Workspace consist of metrics, dimensions, segments, and time granularities that you can drag-and-drop onto a project. Custom components that you create are added to these panels, such as custom date ranges.

To access the Components panel, click the **[!UICONTROL Components]** icon in the left rail. You can switch among Panels (Blank panel, [Freeform panel](../../../analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table.md#concept_0D2E24FCCBAF4194AA941448860E422F), or [Segment Comparison](../../../analyze/analysis-workspace/c-panels/c-segment-comparison/segment-comparison.md#concept_74FAC1C6D0204F9190A110B0D9005793) panel), [Visualizations](../../../analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-analysis-visualizations.md#concept_09242627629147A88A68F1506954C276), and Components using the left-rail icons or by using [hotkeys](../../../analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/fa-shortcut-keys.md#concept_9A6356084DBC4D468E265E7A65B3E051).
