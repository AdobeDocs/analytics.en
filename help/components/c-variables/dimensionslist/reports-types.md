# Report Categories

Descriptions of report categories used in the Experience Cloud.

A **ranked report** displays a table with ranked items, using numbers and percentages in metrics. For example, a Pages Report ranks the pages on your site based on traffic, and the detail table shows percentages and numbers for metrics like Page Views and Revenue. A horizontal bar chart is the default graph type. Graphs display a color for each metric. Ranked reports can display multiple metrics in a report. 
A **trended report** lets you examine how conversions and events trend over a selected time granularity (Hour, Day, Week, Month, Quarter, or Year) during a reporting period.

In the graph, the vertical axis displays the tracked items. The horizontal axis displays the time granularity. In the table, you can trend from a specific cell, and launch a full report from the cell. The date or time used is based the cell's value.

You can also select multiple cells and launch a trended report, based on a selected granularity. When you trend from multiple cells, the report columns display data for the entire reporting period.

A Products Report is an example of a trended report. You can see how much revenue a product made during the selected period. If your reporting period is a week, you can see how much revenue that product generated for each day of the time period, you can show a trend graph for a specific product on that day, or open a separate trended report for the selection. 
A Totals report is an executive-level report that shows bottom-line figures. It contains data for total revenue, page views, and orders. You can segment the report and add additional metrics to view additional data. 
Flow shows the most common paths users take across pages, site sections, and servers.

For information on how Flow works in Analysis Workspace, see [Customer Journey - Flow](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/analysis-workspace/flow.html).

**Next Flow**

The Next Flow report group has three reports: Next Page Flow, Next Section Flow, and Next Server Flow. The reports in this group show you the most common pages, site sections, and servers that a visitor accessed after accessing the page, site section, or server you specify. These reports show you the most common paths taken through your website.

**Previous Flow**

Previous Flow reports are similar to Next Flow reports, except rather than seeing where visitors went after a selected page, you see where visitors were before visiting a specified page. The controls for using the report are identical to the controls for the Next Flow reports. 
Fallout visualizations provide more options to build your fallout reports. Fallout reports show where visitors left (fell out) and continued through (fell through) a predefined sequence of pages. For more information, see [Fallout](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/analysis-workspace/fallout_flow.html) in Analysis Workspace.
