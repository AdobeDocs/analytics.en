# Classification set settings

You can edit the settings of a classification set. 

In the Classifications set manager, select the classification set for which you want to edit the settings.

In the **[!UICONTROL Settings]** tab of the **[!UICONTROL Classification Set: _classification set title_]** dialog, where appropriate:

1. Edit the **[!UICONTROL Name]**.
1. Edit a **[!UICONTROL Description (optional)]**.
1. Edit the list of email addresses (comma separater) in **[!UICONTROL Notify of issues]**. These users are notified by email of any issues.
1. Add one or more **[!UICONTROL Tags (optional)]** to the classification set. Select an existing tag from the **[!UICONTROL Tags]** drop-down menu, or enter a new tag. Use ![CrossSize100](/help/assets/icons/CrossSize100.svg) to remove a tag.
1. Edit the **[!UICONTROL Subscriptions]**.  
   * You can define multiple **[!UICONTROL Report Suite]** and **[!UICONTROL Dimension]** combinations to a classification set.
