# Analyze traffic from AI chatbots

Adobe Analytics provides tools for analyzing AI traffic to your website.

AI traffic on your website occurs in any of the following circumstances:

* **During pretraining**: Occurs less frequently. Content from your website is included in the AI training data. 

* **For individual responses**: Occurs any time a user prompts AI with a question and the AI chatbot response includes content from your website. (Otherwise known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).)

* For individual responses that include links to your site: These responses can include links to source material. When a user clicks one of these links

* **For agentic workflows**: Occurs any time an AI agent clicks through a series of web pages in a browser in order to respond to a user request.
