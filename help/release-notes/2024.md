| Feature | Description | [Rollout starts](releases.md) | [General Availability](releases.md) |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| **Change to deletion protocol for Workspace projects** |  Previously, deleted projects were never purged from the system. We will now start purging deleted projects after 180 days. During the 180 days after deletion, users can still access a deleted project via the Web interface if they have a URL to the project. | | March 14, 2024|
| **AppMeasurement update** | [AppMeasurement release v2.26.0](/help/implement/appmeasurement-updates.md) is available. | | March 4, 2024 |
| **New column available on the Projects landing page** | The **[!UICONTROL Last used]** column is now available when viewing the Projects tab on the [Adobe Analytics landing page](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/landing.html). <p>This information can help you determine whether a project is valuable to users in your organization by showing the date and time when the project was last opened.</p> <p>Previously, the **[!UICONTROL Last used]** column was available only in the Calculated metrics manager, Segments manager, and Alerts manager.</p> |  | March 13, 2024 |
| **Analytics support for consent flags required by Google for DMA** | Due to new European privacy regulations, Google requires that data collected in Europe that was sent to them must indicate whether two particular kinds of consent were granted.Â **Starting March 6th**, Google will no longer accept event data that does not indicate that the relevant consent was granted. Adobe Analytics has released support for capturing this data via a new adConsent variable. You can see the new variable listed in the [Privacy Reporting UI](/help/admin/admin/c-manage-report-suites/c-edit-report-suites/privacy-reporting.md). If you would like to activate this and already have privacy enabled for the previous consent variables, you will need to enable privacy again.<p>The [Ad Platform Consent dimension](/help/components/dimensions/ad-consent.md) displays whether consent is collected to send data to third-party advertising providers like Google. |  | March 13, 2024 |

### Important notices for Adobe Analytics administrators

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **13-month expiration of saved `cust_visids`**  | March 20, 2024 | An upcoming release of the Analytics Hit processing engine, targeted for April or May, will start enforcing a 13-month expiration of saved `cust_visids`. If the report suite has "Enable Visitor Stitching" enabled, this setting is used for finding the `cust_visid` for a `visid_high/visid_low value` with no `cust_visid` on the hit. Currently, there is no expiration of the mapping of a `cust_visid` for a `visid_high/visid_low`. With this release, if 13 months or more have passed since `visid_high/visid_low` has had a `cust_visid` on a hit, the mapping will expire. | 
| **Adobe API object member additions** | January 17, 2024 | Adobe may add optional request and response members (name/value pairs) to existing API objects at any time and without notice or changes in versioning. Adobe recommends that you refer to the API documentation of any third-party tool you integrate with our APIs so that such additions are ignored in processing, if not understood. If implemented properly, such additions are non-breaking changes for your implementation. Adobe will not remove parameters or add required parameters without first providing standard notification through release notes. |
| **`getPageLoadTime` plugin deprecated** | January 10, 2024 | This plugin is no longer supported. Its code utilizes the performance.timing method, which (according to MDN) has been [deprecated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming). Work on an updated plugin has started. |

| **Increase in default low-traffic thresholds**| In **mid April 2024**, Adobe will begin increasing the default report suite low-traffic thresholds as follows: ![low-traffic thresholds](assets/thresholds.png) This will impact only variables which are currently set below the new thresholds. These changes will be made incrementally, and we expect the work to be complete by the **end of May**. As these increases are rolled out, you may notice changes for high-cardinality variables:<ul><li>More dimension values may be available for reporting.</li><li>Segments and calculated metrics may include more data.</li><li>Virtual report suites based on segments may include more data.</li><li>Classification exports may include more data.</li></ul> | Mid April, 2024 | End of May, 2024 |
