# Targets

Targets reports let you measure your website performance and track progress against target goals. For example, you might want to increase the number of visitors that come from a geographic region, the revenue per order, or the number of hits that come from a specific referrer.

>[!NOTE]

>These reports should not be confused with the Adobe [Target](/help/components/c-variables/dimensionslist/reports-tnt.md#topic_EBC899DB84A84780A1B8EE95C6C4CF18) report.

To access your Targets reports, go to **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Reports]** > **[!UICONTROL Targets]** > **[!UICONTROL [your target name]]**

When you [create targets](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/user/targets.html), you select which attribute metrics or eVars you want to measure or you can choose to measure your entire site against your selected metric.

The report shows the cumulative total of the metric you specified and the difference between that total and the target you set when you configured the report.

You can also manage your targets under **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Components]** > **[!UICONTROL Targets]**.
