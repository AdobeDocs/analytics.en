# Date abbreviations

Time abbreviations refer to a particular date when a period begins, not a range of days. A range of days is expressed by specifying a start and an end date for two time abbreviations (or terms).

For information about using proper syntax, see [Syntax Notes](../../../../report-builder/data-requests/configuring-report-dates/c-customized-date-expressions/examples-of-date-ranges-using-customized-expressions.md#section_555D6563B2D94FA3BDD801DC0B8C289D).

* cd = current date (today) 
* cw = current week (first day of the current week) 
* cm = current month (first day of current month) 
* cq = current quarter (first day of current quarter) 
* cy = current year (first day of current year)

In the following list, *[UNIT]* indicates any integer multiplier.

* * [UNIT]* d = day 
* * [UNIT]* w = week 
* * [UNIT]* m = month 
* * [UNIT]* q = quarter 
* * [UNIT]* y = year
