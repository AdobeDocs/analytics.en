# Report types overview

You can select the base report type for your data request, such as Site Metrics, Site Content, and Video.

You can choose only one base report type for a range of spreadsheet cells. If you are editing a previously created request, you can change the report type on the [!UICONTROL Request Wizard: Step 1] window without having to reconfigure other settings in the request.

You can search for reports using the auto-complete search bar. Once you have selected a report from this control, the tree view will automatically select the matching node.
