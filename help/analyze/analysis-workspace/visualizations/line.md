# Line

This visualization represents metrics using a line in order to show how values change over a period of time. A line chart can be used only when time is used as a dimension.

## Visualization settings

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> Some Line visualization settings, such as Show trendline, are currently in limited testing. [Learn more](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/landing/an-releases.html).

Click on the gear icon in the top right of the Line visualization to access [**Visualization settings**](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-analysis-visualizations.html#section_D3BB5042A92245D8BF6BCF072C66624B) available. Settings are categorized into:

* General - settings that are common across visualization types
* Axis - settings that will impact the x- or y-axis of the line visualization
* Overlays - options for adding additional context to the series shown in your line visualization.

### Change granularity

A granularity drop-down in the [visualization settings](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-analysis-visualizations.md#section_D3BB5042A92245D8BF6BCF072C66624B) lets you change a trended visualization (e.g. line, bar) from daily to weekly to monthly, etc. The granularity will also be updated in the data source table.

### Show min or max

Under **Visualization Settings > Overlays > Show min/max**, you can overlay a minimum and maximum value label to quickly highlight the peaks and valleys in a metric.

### Show trendline overlay

Under **Visualization Settings > Overlays > Show trendline**, you can choose to add a regression trendline to your line series. Trendlines help to depict a clearer pattern in the data. 

All models are fit using ordinary least squares:

|Model|Description|
|---|---|
|Linear|Creates a best-fit straight line for simple linear data sets and is useful when the data increases or decreases at a steady rate. Equation: y = a + b * x|
|Logarithmic|Creates a best-fit curved line and is useful when the rate of change in the data increases or decreases quickly and then levels out. A logarithmic trendline can use negative and positive values. Equation: y = a + b * log(x)|
|Exponential|Creates a curved line and is useful when data rises or falls at constantly increasing rates. This option should not be used if your data contains zero or negative values. Equation: y = a + e<sup>b * x|
|Power|Creates a curved line and is useful for data sets that compare measurements that increase at a specific rate. This option should not be used if your data contains zero or negative values. Equation: y = a * x<sup>b|
|Quadratic|Finds the best-fit for a data set shaped like a parabola (concave up or down). Equation: y = a + b * x + c * x<sup>2|
|Polynomial| Useful when your data set fluctuates, such as analyzing gains and losses over a large data set. Equation: y = a + b * x + â€¦ + k * x<sup>order|
