# Analysis Workspace overview

>This page is currently under construction.

Analysis Workspace removes all of the typical limitations of a single Analytics report. It provides a robust, flexible canvas for building custom analysis projects. Drag-and-drop any number of data tables, visualizations, and components (dimensions, metrics, segments, and time granularities) to a project. Instantly create breakdowns and segments, create cohorts for analysis, create alerts, compare segments, do flow and fallout analysis, and curate and schedule reports for sharing with anyone in your business. 

Start with PAGE for basic instructions to get started with Workspace. When you have mastered the basics, you can move on to its  advanced features of Workspace. These include [Attribution IQ](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/attribution/overview.md), [Anomaly Detection](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/virtual-analyst/c-anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection.md), [Contribution Analysis](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/virtual-analyst/contribution-analysis/ca-tokens.md), [Segment IQ](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/segment-iq.md), and [Intelligent Alerts](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/c-intelligent-alerts/intellligent-alerts.md).
