# Add dependent requests

A dependent request is a request that is dependent upon an existing request.

For reports with correlation breakdowns enabled within the report table, you can take a closer look at an item by right-clicking in the cell and clicking **[!UICONTROL Add Dependent Request]** > **[!UICONTROL Breakdown]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can also add breakdown request while creating the original request. See [Create a Data Request](../../../analyze/report-builder/data-requests/t-create-a-data-request.md#task_65B453C8F015429A8EA73A1B64025B6C).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Report Builder enforces request dependencies only within the same worksheet, not across worksheets. Restricting to dependencies within a single worksheet ensures timeliness of execution.
