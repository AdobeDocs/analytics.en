# Share Workspace projects

Sharing makes a project available to other Analysis Workspace users in your organization. Any [curation](curate.md) you have applied is reflected when recipients open the project. 

## Project roles

You can add recipients to one of three project roles. Project roles are tied to the user and specific project ID. 

>[!NOTE]
> Project roles are independent of user permissions managed in the Experience Cloud admin console.

|Role|Project control|
|---|---|
|Can edit|Recipients can Save changes to a project and function as co-owners.<br>This role is useful if you want to collaborate with colleagues on a project.|
|Can duplicate|Recipients can Save As and have access to the left rail. Interactions are not limited.<br>This role is useful if you want to share a project to users who understand your organization’s data and how to use Analysis Workspace, but you do not want your saved project altered.|
|Can view|Recipients cannot Save As and do not have access to the left rail. Interactions are also limited.<br>This role is useful if you want to share a project to users that are less familiar with your organization’s data structure, Analysis Workspace or Adobe Analytics generally. However, you still want them to consume data and insights in a safe environment.<br>Learn more about the [Can view project experience](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/curate-share/view-only-projects.md).|

### No role assigned

If a recipient is not assigned a role and receives a link to the project ([!UICONTROL Share] > [!UICONTROL Get project link]), they will be placed in the [!UICONTROL "Can view"] role by default. 

### Multiple roles assigned

If a recipient is placed in multiple roles, they will always get the highest control. This might occur if a user is added both as an individual and as part of a group. For example, if user 1 is given Can edit and [!UICONTROL "Can view"] roles, they will have [!UICONTROL "Can edit"] control of the project. 

### Admins and roles

Admins placed in a [!UICONTROL"Can duplicate"] or [!UICONTROL "Can view"] role will receive those limited experiences when they open a project. If desired, an Admin can increase their role to [!UICONTROL "Can edit"] at anytime through [!UICONTROL Components] > [!UICONTROL Projects]. 

## Add recipients to shared project

To add recipients to your shared project: 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Share]** > **[!UICONTROL Share project]**. 
   If there are unsaved changes, you will be prompted to save your project first. 
1. Add recipients or groups of users. 
   Reference the help icon at the top for descriptions of each role. 
1. (Optional) Share embedded project components (segments, calculated metrics, and date ranges) with all recipients. 
   After being shared, these components will appear in the Components drop-down of the recipient's Workspace. Note that this setting does not persist - it is a singular action at the time of sharing. 
1. (Optional) Set this page as the landing page for recipients.
   This setting does not persist - it is a singular action at the time of sharing. 
1. Click Share. 
  You can also click **[!UICONTROL Curate and Share]** to apply project curation automatically. If a project has already been shared, these buttons will say **[!UICONTROL Update]** and **[!UICONTROL Curate & Update]**. Learn more about [project curation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/curate-share/curate.html).

## Share to groups of recipients

All users can share projects to groups, which are a collection of recipients. In Adobe Analytics, groups are defined by product profiles in the Adobe Experience Cloud.  

* Admins can share to any group, including “All”.  
* Non-admins can share to groups they are a member of, with the exception of “All”. 

## Share projects in the Project manager 

Projects can also be shared from [!UICONTROL Components] > [!UICONTROL Projects]. A single project can be shared following the same steps above.  

If multiple projects are selected to be shared, recipients will be added to the existing list of recipients for each project. For example: 

* Project A is shared to users 1, 2, 3 
* Project B is shared to user 4, 5, 6 
* With Project A and B selected, users 4 and 7 are added to the recipient lists. The new recipient list for each project is now: 
   * Project A: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 
   * Project B: 4, 5, 6, 7
