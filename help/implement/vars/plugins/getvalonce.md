# Adobe plug-in: getValOnce

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This plug-in is provided by Adobe Consulting as a courtesy to help you get more value out of Adobe Analytics. Adobe Customer Care does not provide support with this plug-in, including installation or troubleshooting. If you require help with this plug-in, contact your organization's Account Manager. They can arrange a meeting with a consultant for assistance.

The `getValOnce` plug-in prevents a variable from being set equal to the same value more than once. Adobe recommends using this plug-in when you would like to deduplicate occurrences where a visitor refreshes a page or otherwise visit a given page multiple times. This plug-in is unnecessary if you are not worried about the 'Occurrences' metric in Analysis Workspace.

## Install the plug-in using the Web SDK or the Adobe Analytics extension

Adobe offers an extension that allows you to use most commonly-used plug-ins.

1. Log in to [Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](https://experience.adobe.com/data-collection) using your AdobeID credentials.
1. Click the desired tag property.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click on the [!UICONTROL Catalog] button
1. Install and publish the [!UICONTROL Common Analytics Plugins] extension
1. If you haven't already, create a rule labeled "Initialize Plug-ins" with the following configuration:
    * Condition: None
    * Event: Core â€“ Library Loaded (Page Top)
1. Add an action to the above rule with the following configuration:
    * Extension: Common Analytics Plugins
    * Action Type: Initialize getValOnce
1. Save and publish the changes to the rule.

## Install the plug-in using custom code editor

If you do not want to use the plug-in extension, you can use the custom code editor.

1. Log in to [Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](https://experience.adobe.com/data-collection) using your AdobeID credentials.
1. Click on the desired property.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click the **[!UICONTROL Configure]** button under the Adobe Analytics extension.
1. Expand the [!UICONTROL Configure tracking using custom code] accordion, which reveals the [!UICONTROL Open Editor] button.
1. Open the custom code editor and paste the plug-in code provided below into the edit window.
1. Save and publish the changes to the Analytics extension.

## Install the plug-in using AppMeasurement

Copy and paste the following code anywhere in the AppMeasurement file after the Analytics tracking object is instantiated (using [`s_gi`](../functions/s-gi.md)). Preserving comments and version numbers of the code in your implementation helps Adobe with troubleshooting any potential issues.

```js
/******************************************* BEGIN CODE TO DEPLOY *******************************************/
/* Adobe Consulting Plugin: getValOnce v3.0 (Requires AppMeasurement) */
function getValOnce(vtc,cn,et,ep){var e=vtc,k=cn,l=et,m=ep;if(arguments&&"-v"===arguments[0])return{plugin:"getValOnce",version:"3.0"};var c=function(){if("undefined"!==typeof window.s_c_il)for(var b=0,a;b<window.s_c_il.length;b++)if(a=window.s_c_il[b],a._c&&"s_c"===a._c)return a}();"undefined"!==typeof c&&(c.contextData.getValOnce="3.0");window.cookieWrite=window.cookieWrite||function(b,a,d){if("string"===typeof b){var h=window.location.hostname,c=window.location.hostname.split(".").length-1;if(h&&!/^[0-9.]+$/.test(h)){c=2<c?
c:2;var f=h.lastIndexOf(".");if(0<=f){for(;0<=f&&1<c;)f=h.lastIndexOf(".",f-1),c--;f=0<f?h.substring(f):h}}g=f;a="undefined"!==typeof a?""+a:"";if(d||""===a)if(""===a&&(d=-60),"number"===typeof d){var e=new Date;e.setTime(e.getTime()+6E4*d)}else e=d;return b&&(document.cookie=encodeURIComponent(b)+"="+encodeURIComponent(a)+"; path=/;"+(d?" expires="+e.toUTCString()+";":"")+(g?" domain="+g+";":""),"undefined"!==typeof cookieRead)?cookieRead(b)===a:!1}};window.cookieRead=window.cookieRead||function(b){if("string"===
typeof b)b=encodeURIComponent(b);else return"";var a=" "+document.cookie,d=a.indexOf(" "+b+"="),c=0>d?d:a.indexOf(";",d);return(b=0>d?"":decodeURIComponent(a.substring(d+2+b.length,0>c?a.length:c)))?b:""};return e&&(k=k||"s_gvo",l=l||0,m="m"===m?6E4:864E5,e!==this.c_r(k))?(c=new Date,c.setTime(c.getTime()+l*m),cookieWrite(k,e,0===l?0:m),e):""};
/******************************************** END CODE TO DEPLOY ********************************************/
```

## Use the plug-in

The `getValOnce` function uses the following arguments:

* **`vtc`** (required, string): The variable to check and see if it was just previously set to an identical value
* **`cn`** (optional, string): The name of the cookie that holds the value to check. Defaults to `"s_gvo"`
* **`et`** (optional, integer): The expiration of the cookie in days (or minutes, depending on the `ep` argument). Defaults to `0`, which expires at the end of the browser session
* **`ep`** (optional, string): Only set this argument if the `et` argument is also set. Set this argument to `"m"` if you want the `et` argument to expire in minutes instead of days. Defaults to `"d"`, which sets the `et` argument in days.

If the `vtc` argument and cookie value match, this function returns an empty string. If the `vtc` argument and cookie value do not match, the function returns the `vtc` argument as a string.

## Examples

```js
// Prevent the same value from being passed in to the campaign variable more than once in a row for next 30 days
s.campaign = getValOnce(s.campaign,"s_campaign",30);

// Prevent the same value from being passed in to eVar2 more than once in a row for the browser session
s.eVar2 = getValOnce(s.eVar2,"s_ev2");

// Prevent the same value from being passed in to eVar8 more than once in a row for 10 minutes
s.eVar8 = getValOnce(s.eVar8,"s_ev8",10,"m");
```

## Version History

### 3.0 (March 19, 2021)

* Added version number as context data.

### 2.01

* Fixed an issue with writing cookies.

### 2.0

* Point release (recompiled, smaller code size).

### 1.1

* Added the option to choose minutes or days for the expiration via the `t` parameter.
* Corrected the scope of the `k` variable used to restrict it to the plug-in only. This change prevents possible interference with other code on the page.
