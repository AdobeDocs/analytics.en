## Company preferences

You can update company preferences that apply to all users and projects within your organization. For information about how to access these preferences, see [Update preferences](#update-preferences). 

| Section | Preference | Options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Reports tab** | | |
|  | Hide Reports Tab | Hides the Reports tab for all users in your organization. |
| **Public link** <!-- Double check the names of all these settings for what they are actually called --> | | |
| | Disable public link creation | Restricts users in your organization from sharing Analysis Workspace projects with people outside of your organization. When public link creation is disabled, the "Share public link" option is removed from the Share menu. (For information about how users can share projects with users outside the organization, see [Share a public link with anyone (no login required)](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/curate-share/share-projects.md#share-public-link) in [Share projects](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/curate-share/share-projects.md).) <p>If public links are disabled and then re-enabled, all previously deactivated links are not automatically reactivated. In this case, users must manually reactivate them for each project from the Share project dialog box.</p> |
| | Impose SSO | Enforces users in your organization to require SSO authentication when they create public links. <p>After this option is enabled, any time a user creates a link to an Analysis Workspace project, the "Require single sign-on (SSO) authentication" option is enabled in the share dialog and it cannot be disabled by the user. (For information about how users can share projects with users outside the organization, see [Share a public link with anyone (no login required)](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/curate-share/share-projects.md#share-public-link) in [Share projects](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/curate-share/share-projects.md).)</p> <p>Consider the following when enabling this option:</p><ul><li><p>When you enable this option, all currently active public links that don't have SSO enabled are deactivated.</p></li> <li><p>If this option is enabled and then later disabled, all previously deactivated links are not automatically reactivated. In this case, users must manually reactivate them from the Share project dialog box.</p></li> <li><p>This option is available only if SSO is implemented in your organization. For information about how system administrators can enable SSO for your organization, see [Set up identity and Single Sign-On](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/set-up-identity.html){target=_blank}.</p></li></ul>  |
| | Show SSO-only options | <!-- this needs updating --> Allows SSO options  <p>Will display if the org is set up with SSO. If they're not, both options are removed. If they do have SSO, then the admin needs to get in touch with the system admin and confirm whether they have any kind of auto-account creation implemented in the console. Even if they don't, if they want public link access to be restricted to users in the admin console that do not have access to Adobe Analytics, â€¦ It's up to the admin whether they want this option to show up in the analytics UI. If they hide it and show it again, nothing happens.</p>  |
| | Password protection | Enforces users in your organization to require password protection when they create public links. <p>After this option is enabled, any time a user creates a link to an Analysis Workspace project, the "Require password" option is enabled in the share dialog and it cannot be disabled by the user. (For information about how users can share projects with users outside the organization, see [Share a public link with anyone (no login required)](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/curate-share/share-projects.md#share-public-link) in [Share projects](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/curate-share/share-projects.md).)</p><p>Consider the following when enabling this option:</p> <ul><li><p>When you enable this option, all currently active public links that don't have password protection enabled are deactivated.</p></li> <li><p>If this option is enabled and then later disabled, all previously deactivated links are not automatically reactivated. In this case, users must manually reactivate them from the Share project dialog box.</p></li></ul> |
