# Quarter

The 'Quarter' dimension reports the quarter that a given metric occurred. The first dimension value is the first quarter in the date range, and the last dimension value is the last quarter in the date range. This dimension is ideal for trended reports, as it allows you to see metrics over time.

## Populate this dimension with data

This dimension works out of the box for all implementations. If a report suite contains data, this dimension works.

## Dimension values

Dimension values include the 3-month quarter and year of a given date.
