When executed in your browser, it shows the image requests that transmitted data from that page into Experience Cloud solutions, along with any variable values or parameters that were captured. This allows you and your developers to check the validity of your implementation on any page on your site.

The [!UICONTROL DigitalPulse Debugger] is officially supported for use in all recent versions and builds of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and Safari.
