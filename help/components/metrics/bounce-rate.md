# Bounce rate

The 'Bounce rate' metric shows the ratio of visits that contained exactly one hit compared to the number of visits on that page. You can use this metric to understand which dimension items have the highest bounce rate, or to see an aggregated total bounce rate of your site over time.

## How this metric is calculated

This metric is calculated using the formula [`Bounces`](bounces.md)` divided by `[`Entries`](entries.md).
