# Configure a real-time request

Steps that describe how to configure real-time request dates.

1. Ensure that real-time reporting is enabled in the [Admin Tools](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/real_time_admin.html) in marketing reports & analytics.
1. On the [!UICONTROL Request Wizard: Step 1], click **[!UICONTROL Real-Time Report]** > **[!UICONTROL `<report type>`]**

   For example, select a Traffic Report. When you select a real-time report type, the [!UICONTROL Select Time Range] options display.
