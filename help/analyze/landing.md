# Adobe Analytics landing page

The landing page for Adobe Analytics brings together both [!DNL Analysis Workspace] and [!DNL Reports & Analytics] (end-of-lifed) in a single interface and access point under the [!DNL Workspace] umbrella. It features a project manager home page, an updated reports menu, modernized reports, and a learning section to help you with getting started more effectively. Here is a video overview:

## Top menu structure {#top-menu}

![Top menu](assets/top-menus.png)

* Top Analytics menu: Most reports are now in the [!UICONTROL Reports] menu in the left rail.
* The left rail has three tabs: [!UICONTROL Projects], [!UICONTROL Reports], and [!UICONTROL Learning].

### Terminology 

* **[!UICONTROL Projects]** are customized designs that combine data components, tables, and visualizations that you built or that someone else built and shared with you. [!UICONTROL Projects] also refers to blank projects and blank mobile scorecards.
* **[!UICONTROL Reports]** refers to anything that was pre-built by Adobe, such as templates in Workspace.
* **[!UICONTROL Templates]** is no longer used as a term for Adobe's pre-built Workspace projects. They are now under [!UICONTROL Reports]. The term [!UICONTROL Templates] is still used for templates your company created.

## Navigate the [!UICONTROL Projects] tab {#navigate-projects}

[!UICONTROL Projects] serves as the [!UICONTROL Workspace] home page. The Projects tab displays the Company folder, any personal folders you created, your projects, and Mobile scorecards. Use this page to view, create, and modify folders, projects, and mobile scorecards. For more information, see [About Folders in Analytics](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/workspace-folders/about-folders.md).

### Deprecation of the Project Manager Page {#deprecate-pm-page}

With the release of the new landing page, we deprecated Project Manager as listed under the Components manager. The new landing page handles all of the functionality of the old Project Manager page and more. 
 
One common use case for the Project Manager page was to view all your projects. 

To view all of your projects on the new landing page by using the filter rail, select **OTHER FILTERS** and then select **Show all**. 

![Show all projects](assets/show-all-fIlter.png)

If you're in the "Folders & Projects" view, a modal will pop-up asking if you want to switch to the "All projects" view which makes it easier to view all of your projects outside of any folders that they may be organized in.   Select **Switch to "All projects" view** to better view all of the projects you have access to. 

![Switch to All projects](assets/switch-all-projects-view.png)

Another use case for Admins is to manage company reports in order to delete, rename, tag, or approve reports. For information about managing reports, see [Managing company reports](#manage-company-reports).

## Navigate the [!UICONTROL Reports] tab {#navigate-reports} 

The [!UICONTROL Reports] tab consolidates the following sets of reports:

* The pre-built [!UICONTROL Workspace] templates that were previously located under [!UICONTROL Workspace] > [!UICONTROL Project] > [!UICONTROL New]. Adobe no longer uses the word "template" in this context.
* Most of the pre-built reports under the previous Adobe Analytics [!UICONTROL Reports] top menu. These reports are now displayed in [Analysis Workspace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.html).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Consider the following when using reports:
>* Under Reports, a Favorites folder shows up only if you mark a new report as a favorite. No pre-existing Reports & Analytics favorites are carried forward.
>* Only the most commonly used reports that were formerly grouped in Reports & Analytics are available. A handful of rarely used or no-longer-relevant reports are no longer available. See the [Landing page FAQ](#landing-page-faq) below for more details.

![Reports tab](assets/reports-tab2.png)

For more information about the Reports tab in Analysis Workspace, including viewing and saving reports, see [Use pre-built reports](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/reports/use-reports.md).

For information about creating and managing custom company reports, see [Create and manage company reports](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/reports/create-company-reports.md).

## Use the Learning tab {#navigate-learning}

The Learning page contains hands-on video tours, tutorials, and links to documentation.

Use the Learning page in Adobe Analytics to learn beginner, intermediate, or advanced features and use-cases in Adobe Analytics.

### Access the Learning page

1. In Adobe Analytics, select [!UICONTROL **Workspace**] > [!UICONTROL **Learning**].

### Learning page features

* **Filter content:** The Filter icon in the left rail allows you to filter learning content by experience level (Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced) and by content type (Document, Video, or Tours & tutorials).
* **Track progress:** After you select a piece of content, a **[!UICONTROL Viewed]** tag appears. This tag helps you track your progress through the learning content. You can select the **[!UICONTROL Viewed]** tag to remove it from a piece of content.
* **View additional content:** While viewing any video, select the **[!UICONTROL Learn more]** button to view related documentation content on Experience League. Or, from the Learning page, select either of the following options to view additional content:

  * [!UICONTROL **Visit Experience League**]: View the full suite of Adobe Analytics documentation on Experience League.

This tour can also be relaunched any time in Workspace via the tooltip pop-over from the panel header.
