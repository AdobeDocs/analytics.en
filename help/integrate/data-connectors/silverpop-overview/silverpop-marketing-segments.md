# Dynamic Marketing Segments{#dynamic-marketing-segments}

This Data Connectors email integration supports dynamic marketing segments to help you drive your business.

This integration features the following marketing segments, out of the box:

* **Purchase Profiles:** Increase repeat orders and average order value through campaigns targeted by visitor purchase patterns. 
* **Product/Content View Behavioral Profile:** Reach prospective customers through marketing segments based on product views and content access profiling. 
* **Cart Abandonment Profile:** Help visitors convert to customers through fine-tuned campaigns specifically designed for those who are hesitant to complete carts. 
* **Form Abandonment Profile (Optional):** Encourage visitors to complete an unfinished form through campaigns specifically designed for those who started and did not complete an online form. This segment will only be created if 2 events are created for form starts and form completes. 
* **File Download Profile (Optional):** Reach potential customers through campaigns designed for those who have shown interest by downloading a white-paper or other type of download. This segment will only be created if 1 event is created for successful file downloads. 
* Customers can also create and schedule custom remarketing segments specific to the needs of their users.
