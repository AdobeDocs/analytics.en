# Image annotations

Using an image annotation, you can copy an image from any source and paste it directly into a workspace.

 You can then resize, invert the color scheme, or dim the image.

## Add an image {#section_BCB71217E75F4135A90A222B27479C9A}

1. Copy any image to your clipboard by right-clicking the image and clicking **[!UICONTROL Copy]**. 
1. Right-click within the image annotation and click **[!UICONTROL Paste Image]**.

>You can add only one image to an image annotation. Pasting a new image into the annotation pastes over the existing image. To add multiple images to a workspace, you must add another image annotation.

## Resize an image {#section_C8136A2573BF4378A9AA18CC6A098B27}

* Click+drag any side or corner of the annotation.

## Invert an image {#section_6248CA0F729F4397AC200FAE0EEF9D9A}

* Right-click within the annotation and click **[!UICONTROL Display Mode]** > **[!UICONTROL Invert (white to black)]** or **[!UICONTROL Display Mode]** > **[!UICONTROL Invert (black to white)]**.

## Dim an image {#section_2D4B66428EA4456E9735C0AD09F3B765}

* Right-click within the annotation and click **[!UICONTROL Display Mode]** > **[!UICONTROL Dim]** or **[!UICONTROL Display Mode]** > **[!UICONTROL Very Dim]**.

## Return to original display mode {#section_044FAD7278BD4947B463DECA1B94ACFD}

* Right-click within the annotation and click **[!UICONTROL Display Mode]** > **[!UICONTROL Original]**.

## Fit to window {#section_904EB9AED20947749BC35525EFEB4BDA}

**To enable or disable the Fit to Window option**

The [!UICONTROL Fit to Window] option, when selected, lets the annotation automatically expand or shrink to fit the image size. The [!UICONTROL Fit to Window] option is enabled by default.

* Right-click within the annotation click **[!UICONTROL Fit to Window]**. When enabled, an X appears to the left of [!UICONTROL Fit to Window].
