**Sign In:** Displays the [!UICONTROL Login] form so that you can log in with your credentials or as a different user. Also displays your company name after login. See [Log In To Report Builder](/help/analyze/report-builder/setup/t-loggin-in-to-reportbuilder.md).

**Create:** Launches the [!UICONTROL Request Wizard]. If you are not logged in, you are prompted to do so. See [Data Requests](/help/analyze/report-builder/data-requests/data-requests.md).

**Manage:** Launches the [!UICONTROL Request Manager]. You can view status, edit, refresh, delete, and manage all Report Builder data requests embedded in your Excel workbook. You can perform these functions on individual requests or on multiple requests at one time. See [Manage Requests](/help/analyze/report-builder/manage-requests/r-arb-manage-requests.md).

**Refresh:** Refreshes the data for all requests embedded in the Excel workbook. See [Refresh a Request](/help/analyze/report-builder/manage-requests/t-refresh-a-request.md).

**Format:** Lets you set conditional formatting to spreadsheet cells. See [Specify Conditional Formatting](/help/analyze/report-builder/manage-requests/specify-conditional-formatting.md).

**Schedule:** Lets you schedule reports to send according to the time and file format that you define. See [Schedule Report Requests](/help/analyze/report-builder/schedule-report-requests.md).

**Library:** Launches the [!UICONTROL Workbook Library] so that you can upload a report builder Excel workbook that you want to share. You can also download and edit shared workbooks. See [Use the Workbook Library](/help/analyze/report-builder/workbook-library/t-upload-a-workbook.md).

**Options:** Lets you specify whether you want to be prompted for the **[!UICONTROL As Of]** (Now) date when refreshing requests, and lets you enable logging for troubleshooting purposes. See [Options](/help/analyze/report-builder/options.md).

**Locked/Unlocked:** You can protect all requests in a workbook against adding and editing requests by locking the workbook. This enables offline editing of workbooks by pausing all report requests for more efficient editing. See [Lock/Unlock Workbooks](/help/analyze/report-builder/workbook-library/protect-wb.md).

**Help:** Launches the Report Builder help documentation you are currently looking at.
