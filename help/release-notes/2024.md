## August 2024 {#aug24}

| Feature | Description | [Rollout starts](releases.md) | [General Availability](releases.md) |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| **Web SDK improvements for link tracking** | Several notable improvements are available in the latest version of the Web SDK around link tracking, which directly benefits Activity Map. These new features are available in both the Web SDK JavaScript library and the Web SDK tag extension.<ul><li>Event grouping: When a visitor clicks an internal link, you can choose to group event data on the next page instead of triggering a separate event call for link tracking. This improvement reduces the number of events that the Web SDK uses against your contractual limit.</li><li>Filter click properties: A new callback that replaces `OnBeforeLinkClickSend`. You can use this callback to filter or obfuscate link-related data before sending it to Adobe.</li></ul><p>See [clickCollection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/web-sdk/commands/configure/clickcollection) in the Web SDK user guide for more information.</p> | Open Beta started July 10, 2024 | July 18, 2024 |

| **13-month expiration of saved `cust_visids`**  | May 22, 2024 | An upcoming release of the Analytics Hit processing engine, **targeted for July 2024**, will start enforcing a 13-month expiration of saved `cust_visids`. If the report suite has "Enable Visitor Stitching" enabled, this setting is used for finding the `cust_visid` for a `visid_high/visid_low value` with no `cust_visid` on the hit. Currently, there is no expiration of the mapping of a `cust_visid` for a `visid_high/visid_low`. With this release, if 13 months or more have passed since `visid_high/visid_low` has had a `cust_visid` on a hit, the mapping expires. | 
| **ISO region updates** | May 10, 2024 | Adobe will perform 2024 ISO region updates on June 7, 2024. Expect to see minor geo information (region) updates following this release. |

| Feature | Description | [Rollout starts](releases.md) | [General Availability](releases.md) |

| **The Streaming Media Collection Add-on: Send Roku data to Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network** | Now when [installing the Streaming Media Collection Add-on with Experience Platform Edge](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/edge-recommended/media-edge-sdk/implementation-edge), you can use the Adobe Experience Platform Roku SDK to send streaming media data to Adobe Experience Platform. |  | April 12, 2024 |
| **Improved workflow for Web SDK migration** | Datastreams now automatically map fields from the Web SDK data object straight to Adobe Analytics. [Data object mapping](/help/implement/aep-edge/data-var-mapping.md) is similar to [XDM object mapping](/help/implement/aep-edge/xdm-var-mapping.md), but does not require an XDM schema. This improved workflow provides the following benefits:<ul><li>It delays the requirement to use a schema until you are ready to send data to Adobe Experience Platform. If a schema was required at this stage of an implementation migration, you would be forced to use a schema based on Adobe Analytics fields. Adobe Experience Platform services, such as Customer Journey Analytics, don't have a concept of props or eVars. An Analytics-focused schema can introduce difficulties if your organization wants to use its own schema in the future.</li><li>After making implementation changes to the Web SDK, your organization is in a better position to migrate from Adobe Analytics to Customer Journey Analytics. If you send data to Adobe Analytics using the Web SDK, you do not need to make additional implementation changes to send data to Adobe Experience Platform. Instead, you can use data prep to map data object fields to your XDM schema.</li></ul>See [Migrate from the Adobe Analytics tag extension to the Web SDK tag extension](/help/implement/aep-edge/web-sdk/analytics-extension-to-web-sdk.md) and [Migrate from AppMeasurement to the Web SDK](../implement/aep-edge/web-sdk/appmeasurement-to-web-sdk.md) for more information. |  | April 2024 |
| **Permissions enhancement for project-only [!UICONTROL Workspace] components** | Previously, if a user (User A) shared a project with another user (User B), and gave User B edit access to the project, User B would be able to edit the project. However, User B would not be able to edit [!UICONTROL Quick Segments] embedded in the project. That limitation is now removed - User B can edit [!UICONTROL Quick Segments] and other project-only components that are embedded in the shared project. |  | April 17, 2024 |

For example, when viewing the [!UICONTROL Data Warehouse] application area, only [!UICONTROL Data Warehouse] locations are available. All accounts are still available in each application area, regardless of the application area where they were created. Previously, all accounts and locations were available in each application area, regardless of the application area where they were created. This is still true when viewing the [!UICONTROL Data Feeds] application area. | | April 17, 2024 |
| **Administrators can manage all locations and accounts in their organization** | A new option on the Locations tab (on the Components > Locations page) allows Administrators to view and manage all locations in the organization.<p>A new option on the [Location](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/components/locations/locations-manager) accounts tab (on the Components > Locations page) allows Administrators to view and manage all accounts in the organization.</p> <p>Previously, administrators could view and manage only the locations and accounts that they created.</p> |  | April 17, 2024 |

| **Activity Map for Web SDK without extra cost** | Currently, Activity Map link events are counted as their own events and incur extra cost. This enhancement takes some link events and packages them into the next hit, similar to how events are handled by AppMeasurement. |  | March 6, 2024 |
| **Increase in default low-traffic thresholds**| In **mid April 2024**, Adobe will begin increasing the default report suite low-traffic thresholds as follows: ![low-traffic thresholds](assets/thresholds.png) This will impact only variables which are currently set below the new thresholds. These changes will be made incrementally, and we expect the work to be complete by the **end of May**. As these increases are rolled out, you may notice changes for high-cardinality variables:<ul><li>More dimension values may be available for reporting.</li><li>Segments and calculated metrics may include more data.</li><li>Virtual report suites based on segments may include more data.</li><li>Classification exports may include more data.</li></ul> | Mid April, 2024 | End of May, 2024 |
