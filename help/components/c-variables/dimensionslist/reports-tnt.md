# Target

View and segment your Adobe Target traffic data in a report.

## Target {#topic_EBC899DB84A84780A1B8EE95C6C4CF18}

View and segment your Adobe Target traffic data in a report. 

Examples include:

* Measuring the success of Adobe Target campaigns through your KPIs. 
* Breaking down Target campaign and recipe data with conversion variables. 
* Breaking down other reports with Target campaign and recipe traffic data.

By leveraging data in Analytics reports, you can drill into your Target recipes using [breakdowns](/help/analyze/reports-analytics/reports-customize/breakdowns.md) and detect high performing segments that are ideal for future tests and potentially targeted campaigns. The report displays Analytics conversion data rather than conversion data from Target.

See the [Target](https://help.testandtarget.omniture.com/) help system for more information.
