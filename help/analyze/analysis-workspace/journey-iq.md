# Journey management features

Adobe Analytics has a set of features that provide easy to use, fully customizable visualizations and settings to understand the customer's experience. These features enable you to measure each touch point in a customer's journey, even across channels. Use these features to understand where to re-engage customers, keep them loyal, and personalize their experiences along the way.

The journey management features are:

* [Cohort analysis:](visualizations/cohort-table/cohort-analysis.md) Visualize retention and engagement of customers to understand where churn happens.
* [Context-aware sessions:](../../components/vrs/vrs-report-time-processing.md) Change the definition of a visit, including when a visit times out and preventing background hits from starting a new visit. Context-aware sessions use a feature called report time processing, part of virtual report suites.
* [Flow analysis:](visualizations/c-flow/flow.md) Understand where users navigate next and where they came from.
* [Fallout analysis:](visualizations/fallout/fallout-flow.md) Capture when a customer disengages, and understand where they go.
* [Cross-device analytics:](../../components/cda/overview.md) Seamlessly merge behavior from multiple devices to understand the customer's touch points on each device.
