# Create a visualization from a process map

You can create other visualizations from a process map.

For example, you can create a graph, table, or scatter plot.

* Right-click any node and click **[!UICONTROL Add Visualization]** > *< **[!UICONTROL visualization type]**>*.

Each node on your process map becomes an element of the Map dimension. You can analyze the node data using the features of the selected visualization.
