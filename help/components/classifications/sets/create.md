# Create a Classification Set

You can use the Classification Set Manager to create a Classification Set.

**[!UICONTROL Components]** > **[!UICONTROL Classification sets]** > **[!UICONTROL Sets]** > **[!UICONTROL Add]**

When creating a classification, the following fields are available.

* **[!UICONTROL Name]**: A text field used to identify the Classification Set.
* **[!UICONTROL Column Name]**: The name of the classification dimension that you want to create. This field is the dimension name used in Analysis Workspace.
* **[!UICONTROL Type]**: Radio buttons that indicate the type of classification. Primary classifications are typically used; Lookup classifications represent [Sub-classifications](../c-sub-classifications.md).
