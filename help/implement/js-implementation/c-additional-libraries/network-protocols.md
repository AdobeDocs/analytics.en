# Mobile network protocols

WAP and I-Mode are the two major protocols or standards used today. WAP is mostly used in the US, and I-Mode is popular in Japan and Europe.

 Sites must often be designed separately for different protocols. The Adobe image tag does not need to be customized for each protocol.

 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> WAP 1.0 </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> WAP 1.0 is quickly losing popularity in the US. This required pages be built in WML, and had its own protocol. </td>

   <td colname="col2"> <p> I-Mode supports CHTML (compact HTML) and does not download third-party images. First-party collection domain implementations should always be used with I-Mode sites so images are downloaded. </p> </td>
