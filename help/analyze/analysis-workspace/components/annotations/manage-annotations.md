# Manage annotations

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is currently in limited testing.

The [!UICONTROL Components] > [!UICONTROL Annotations] manager offers many ways of managing annotations, such as sharing, filtering, tagging, approving, copying, deleting, and marking as favorites.

The [!UICONTROL Annotations] manager shows you all the annotations you own that have been scoped to all your projects, and that have been shared with you. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>[!UICONTROL Annotations] that you created only for a specific project do not appear in the manager.

## Annotations Manager user interface

![](assets/annotation-mgr.png)

| UI Element | Description |
| --- | --- | 
| [!UICONTROL Title and Description] | Provided in the Annotations Builder. To edit the title and description, click the title link - this takes you back to the Annotations Builder.  |
| [!UICONTROL Report Suite] | The report suite(s) that this annotation applies to.  | 
| [!UICONTROL Owner] | Indicates who owns the annotation. As a non-Admin, you can see only annotations that you own or those that were shared with you. |
| [!UICONTROL Applied Date Range] | The date or date range that this annotation applies to. |
| [!UICONTROL Shared with] | Lists how many individuals or groups that you shared the annotation with. Click for more detail. |
| [!UICONTROL Date Modified] | Shows the date and time that the annotation was last modified. |

## Edit annotations

Editing an annotation means that you can adjust date ranges, colors, scope, or whether or not it applies to all report suites or projects. You can edit annotations in two ways:

* In a line chart, hover over the annotation and click the pencil icon within the popover.

* In the [!UICONTROL Annotations Manager], click the title of the annotation.

Both of these options land you back in the Annotations Builder. There, you can make the necessary adjustments and save the new version.

## Other annotations tasks

The Annotations manager lets Administrators edit, add, tag, delete, rename, approve, copy, export, and filter annotations. It is not visible to non-Admin users. 

Just select one or more of the annotations and the Task bar appears.

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Add | Takes you to the Annotations builder where you can create new annotations. |
| Tag | All users can create tags for annotations and apply one or more tags to an annotation. However, you can see tags only for those segments that you own. What kinds of tags should you create? Here are some suggestions for useful tags:<ul><li>Tags based on team names, such as Social Marketing, Mobile Marketing</li><li>Project tags (analysis tags), such as Entry-page analysis</li><li>Category tags: Men's; geography</li><li>Workflow tags: Curated for (a specific business unit); Approved</li></ul>|
| Delete | Deleting an annotation removes it from any project in your organization. |
| Rename | Renaming an annotation renames it in all projects that it was applied to. |
| Copy | Creates a distinct copy with its own annotation ID, but with the same name and definition.|
| Export to CSV | Export the annotation definition to a .csv file.|
| Filter (left rail) | Filter by tags, report suite, owners, and other filters (Mine, Approved, Favorites, Shared with me, and Show All).|
