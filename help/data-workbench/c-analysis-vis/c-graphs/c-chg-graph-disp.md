# Change a graph display

By default, graph visualizations display bars, but you can easily display the bars as lines and vice versa.

 Both display types are shown in the following example.

**To select the display type**

Right-click the dimension label at the bottom of the graph and click **[!UICONTROL Display]** > **[!UICONTROL Draw lines]** or **[!UICONTROL Display]** > **[!UICONTROL Draw bars]**. An X appears to the left of the active display mode.
