| **[Activity Map](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/activity-map/activity-map.html)** | Activity Map is an Adobe Analytics application that is designed to rank link activity using visual overlays and provide a dashboard of real-time analytics to monitor audience engagement of your web pages. <br>Activity Map lets you set up different views to visually identify the acceleration of customer activity, quantify marketing initiatives, and act on audience needs and behaviors." |

| **[Analytics APIs](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/2.0/)** | Analytics APIs allow you to directly call Adobe's servers to perform almost any action that you can perform in the user interface. You can create reports to explore, get insights, or answer important questions about your data. You can also manage components of Adobe Analytics, such as the creation of segments or calculated metrics. |
| **[Reports & Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/reports-analytics/getting-started.html)** | Reports & Analytics is a tool with dozens of pre-built reports and visualizations. These are now available within Analysis Workspace. **Effective December 31, 2023, Adobe intends to discontinue Reports & Analytics and its accompanying reports and features. Adobe recommends using Analysis Workspace for most reporting needs.** For additional information, see [Analysis Workspace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.html). |
