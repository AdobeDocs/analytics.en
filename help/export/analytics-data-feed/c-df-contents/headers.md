# Data feed header resources

Some data feeds have more than just `hit_data.tsv` and lookup tables. These extra data files depend on the feed's settings, and typically don't include a header file in the feed itself. The following lists and downloads are references for these extra data files.

## Mobile attributes

Mobile attributes show properties of the mobile device in the hit. This file appears when:

* Dynamic lookups are enabled. A support delegate in your organization can contact Customer Care with the desired feed ID to enable dynamic lookups.
* The `mobile_id` column is included.
* The `user_agent` column is excluded. This exclusion is required due to licensing agreements with DeviceAtlas.

Download `mobile_attributes_headers.tsv`, or reference the list here:
