# What's New in Analysis Workspace

## March 2020

New features released on March 12, 2020.

| Feature | Description |
|--- |--- |
|Support for multiple report suites in Workspace|You can now bring in data from multiple report suites into a single project to view side by side. [Learn more...](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/multiple-report-suites.html)|
|Training Tutorial template|This new standard template walks you through common terminology and steps for building your first analysis in Workspace. It is available as a standard template in the New Project modal and replaces the sample project that exists today for new users that do not have other projects in their list. [Learn more...](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/starter-projects.md)|

## February 2020

New features released on February 20, 2020.

| Feature | Description |
|--- |--- |
|New Workspace template for organizations using Cross-Device Analytics|This template shows how effective CDA is at stitching visits together and educates you on CDA-exclusive dimensions and metrics. A report suite using CDA is required. See [Setting up Cross-Device Analytics](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/components/cda/cda-setup.html) for more information.|
|New hotkeys in Workspace|<ul><li>Collapse/Expand All panels: `alt + m`</li><li>Collapse/Expand Active panel: `alt + ctrl + m`</li><li>Search left rail: `ctrl + /`</li><li>Move to next panel: `alt + Right Key`</li><li>Move to previous panel: `alt + Left Key`</li></ul>[Learn more...](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/fa-shortcut-keys.html)|
|Other Workspace enhancements|<ul><li>When a panel or visualization is dropped into Workspace, the left rail will now auto-switch to components for a more seamless workflow.</li><li>Template components can now be actioned upon (e.g. tagged, favorited, approved).</li><li>Filtered metric and segment lists offer the + button to add a new component if you don't find what you need.</li></ul>|
|Workspace debugger|The Workspace debugger has been added to the Help menu, giving you a more seamless way to enable it for debugging Workspace requests. [Learn more...](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experiencecloud/analytics/docs.html#!AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis/master/reporting-tricks.md)|

## January 2020

New feature released on January 16, 2020.

| Feature | Description |
|--- |--- |
|[Freeform Table Builder](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table.html)|With Table Builder enabled, you can drag and drop in many dimensions, breakdowns, metrics and segments to build tables that answer more complex business questions. Data will not update immediately. Instead, updates occur after you click **[!UICONTROL Build]**, saving you time once you know what table you want to construct. Additionally, this feature offers:<ul><li>**Preview**: You can preview the format of a table before spending time to render real data.</li><li>**Flexible Row and breakdown settings**: You can set your row and breakdown levels for every dimension row. Previously, Workspace imposed defaults that could not be changed until after the data was returned.</li><li>**Breakdown by position**: You can set dimension rows to always _breakdown by position_ instead of _by specific item_ (the default).</li><li>**Manual static row ordering**: You can manually order static rows so that the table rows are displayed exactly as you need them. Previously, static rows could be sorted only by a metric column or alphabetically.</li></ul>|

## October 2019

Enhancements released on October 10, 2019.

| Enhancement | Description |
|--- |--- |
|Update to Freeform table totals|Freeform tables now include two totals, a **[!UICONTROL Table total]** and a **[!UICONTROL Grand total]**. The Table total row accounts for [report filters](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/pagination-filtering-sorting.html) applied. Previously, only segmentation impacted totals. [Learn more](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/workspace-totals.html)<br/>In addition, **[!UICONTROL Show Totals]** and **[!UICONTROL Show Grand Total]** options have been added to **[!UICONTROL Column Settings]**.<br/>With this change to Freeform totals, dependent visualizations will be updated (e.g. linked **[!UICONTROL Summary Number]** visualizations), as well as exported CSV and PDF data. |
|Option to remove Unspecified/None|The ability to easily remove ‘Unspecified (None)’ has been added as an option to report filters.|
|Deprecation of purple granularity components|Purple granularity time components (Minute, Hour, Day, Week, Month, Quarter, Year) have been deprecated. The purple time components have always behaved exactly like their orange dimension counterparts, so this change will simplify the experience. **No action** needs to taken if you previously used one of the purple time components.<br/>With this change, the purple **[!UICONTROL Time]** section has also been renamed to **[!UICONTROL Date Ranges]**.|

## August 2019

Enhancement released on August 8, 2019.

| Enhancement | Description |
|--- |--- |
|Increase item limit for dropdown filter from 50 to 200| We increased the limit of items that can be placed in a dropdown filter from 50 to 200. This enhancement accommodates a variety of use cases, such as adding all countries (195) to a filter, or all US states and provinces (52). |

## July 2019

Enhancements released on July 18, 2019.

| Enhancement | Description |
|--- |--- |
|Cohort Analysis enhancements| New [Cohort Analysis settings](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/cohort-table/t-cohort.html) have been added: <ul><li>Only show percent</li><li>Round percent to nearest whole</li><li>Show an average percent row</li></ul> |
|Show items from last 18 months| In the left rail, users now have the option to _Show items from last 18 months_. Previously, the lookback period was a maximum of 6 months. This makes it easier to compare to pages or campaigns from last year, up to 18 months ago. |
| New Analysis Workspace template | We added a new template called ["Magento: Marketing & Commerce"](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/starter-projects.html) to Analysis Workspace. It is designed specifically for Magento e-commerce customers, but any retailer can use it to get unique insights into their commerce activities. |

## June 2019

Enhancement released on June 13, 2019.

| Enhancement | Description |
|--- |--- |
|New out-of-the-box filters| Added new out-of-the-box filters to the left rail search. Beyond what you see today (Dimensions, Metrics, Approved, etc.), new filters such as Calculated Metrics, Customer Attributes, eVars, Props, Video, etc. were added to make it easier to find the components you need. | 

## May 2019

Enhancement released on May 09, 2019.

| Enhancement | Description |
|--- |--- |
|A new setting was added to the Flow visualization settings: Include Repeat Instances.|[Flow Settings](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/c-flow/flow-settings.md)|

## April 2019

Enhancement released on April 11, 2019.

| Enhancement | Description |
|--- |--- |
| Enhancements to optimization best practices | [Optimizing Performance](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/new-features-in-analysis-workspace.md)|

## January 2019

New features and enhancements released on January 17, 2019.

| Feature | Description |
|--- |--- |
|[Cohort Analysis](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/cohort-table/cohort-analysis.md)|Major improvements to Cohort Analysis let you:<ul><li>Apply a segment inclusion and return metrics separately. </li><li>Show churn instead of retention.</li><li>Show latency tables (time elapsed before and after an inclusion event).</li><li>Customize cohort dimension (to group visitors based on an eVar, not just time).</li><li>Do a rolling cohort calculation: calculate retention/churn based on prior time period, not original cohort. </li><li>Add in multiple metrics in inclusion & return fields, as well as apply segments. (Calculated metrics are not supported)</li></ul>|
|[View Density](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/view-density.md)|This new setting lets you see more data on a single screen by reducing the vertical padding of the left rail, freeform tables and cohort tables. Accessible via Project > Project Info & Settings.|
|[Support for multi-valued variables in Attribution IQ](attribution-iq.md)|Some dimensions in Analytics can contain multiple values on a single hit, such as listVars, the product variable, list props, or merchandising eVars. Analysis Workspace lets you apply Attribution IQ to any of these types of variables at the hit level.|
|Performance improvements|Speed improvements to breakdown visualizations - projects with lots of breakdowns will load faster.|

## November 2018

New features and enhancements released on November 1, 2018.

| Feature | Description |
|--- |--- |
|[VRS and project curation - enhancements](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/curate-share/curate-projects-vrs.md)|These changes were actually introduced in October 2018. Changes were made to which components administrators and non-administrators can see in curated Workspace projects and curated virtual reports suites (VRSs). <br> Previously, anyone could see non-curated components when clicking Show all Components. The updated curation experience allows for more fine-grained control over which components are visible.</br>|

## June 2016

New features released on June 16, 2016: 

* [New group permission](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/groups.html) that allows administrators to allow or deny access to the **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Workspace]** tab for users. As of June 16, 2016, all users have permission to access this tab. To deny access, just remove users from the Analysis Workspace Access group.
* The [Segment Comparison Panel](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/c-panels/c-segment-comparison/segment-comparison.md)discovers the most statistically significant differences between any two segments through an automated analysis of every single metric and dimension you have access to.
* [New Projects Menu structure](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md) that rearranges the top menu and makes it more extensible. For example, creating a **new Cohort Panel** now involves creating a Blank Panel and dragging in a Cohort Table visualization.
* [New left rail](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md): Panels, Visualizations, Components 
* A new [Venn visualization type](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/venn.md) that lets you drag in up to 3 segments and a metric and build a Venn diagram.
* [Trend Selection](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/analysis-workspace-features.md#section_34930C967C104C2B9092BA8DCF2BF81A) (line chart) on a ranked table is now linked.
* ["Create Visual" icon](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-analysis-visualizations.md): clicking this icon provides an intelligent guess at your next action (bar chart, Venn...).
* Expanded [Manual Rows](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/column-row-settings/manual-vs-dynamic-rows.md) functionality 
* [Add Segment](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/t-freeform-project-segment.md) drop zone 
* Minor Updates:

    * Ability to delete all visualizations in a panel, and all panels in a project. (Previously, you had to keep at least one visualization or one panel.) 
    * Changes to the [shortcut keys](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/fa-shortcut-keys.md) (hotkeys) that can facilitate work with Analysis Workspace.
    * Style changes: Smaller fonts in visualizations; color swatches on rows; moved the date selector down (on panels).

## Undo Actions {#section_12890C393D5E4FC8A3CF050318BD8482}

You can now undo most actions you take in Analysis Workspace.

To undo, click **[!UICONTROL Undo]** from the action menu.

![](assets/undo.png)

You can also use standard Windows and Mac [keyboard shortcuts](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/fa-shortcut-keys.md) (ctrl or cmd + z) for Undo.

*`Undo`* is particularly useful when undoing breakdowns in the table.

Actions that are *`not`* undoable:

* Changing the configuration of a [!UICONTROL Cohort Table] (such as dragging metrics, changing values). However, you can click **[!UICONTROL Undo]** after clicking **[!UICONTROL Run]**.

* Resizing or moving panels and sub-panels.

Actions that clear your undo history:

* Saving the project.
* Changing the report suite.

## Link to This Project {#section_453E70F7409F4501B8E976A0D18C9A46}

In a project, click **[!UICONTROL Link to This Project]** from the Actions menu to email a saved project's URL to other users. Administrative recipients can edit and save a project shared this way. Otherwise, these projects are read only.

![](assets/link-to-this-project.png)

> [!NOTE] Sharing report links is not available if your company uses single sign-on (both the legacy single sign-on and when logging in via the Experience Cloud).

## Bullet Graph, Scatterplot, and Treemap Visualizations {#section_B19EA50EBF5546E99D3A142827153FD6}

The following new visualizations are available in the January 2016 release.

**Bullet Graph**

You can see how a value you are interested in compares to or measures against other performance ranges (goals).

![](assets/bullet-image.png)

The bullet graph features a single, primary measure (for example, current year-to-date revenue), compares that measure to one or more other measures to enrich its meaning (for example, compared to a target revenue), and displays it in the context of qualitative ranges of performance, such as high, mid, and low. You can specify goal ranges in [!UICONTROL Visualization Settings].

**Scatterplot**

![](assets/scatter.png)

Shows impressions served and how many unique users have seen those impressions. The size of each data point provides a visual cue about the average number of times a viewer was exposed to an ad. The size and data vary according to the dimensions, date ranges, and filters you select.

> [!NOTE] A table associated with a Scatterplot chart requires at least two columns. The first column defines the X axis, and the second column defines the Y axis. If there is a third column available, the Scatterplot chart uses it to determine the radius of the dot. In other words, columns *1*, *2*, and *3* map to *X*, *Y*, and *dot radius*.

**Treemap**

Displays hierarchical (tree-structured) data as a set of nested rectangles. Each branch of the tree is given a rectangle, which is then tiled with smaller rectangles representing sub-branches.

![](assets/treemap.png)

When the color and size dimensions are correlated in some way with the tree structure, one can often easily see patterns that would be difficult to spot in other ways, such as if a certain color is particularly relevant. A second advantage of treemaps is that, by construction, they make efficient use of space.

## Save As for Segments, Metrics, and Dates {#section_04C8B10A0751453AAE5F1BC35938C6CE}

When editing an existing (saved) segment the Analysis Workspace Segment Builder, click **[!UICONTROL Save As]** to make a copy.

![](assets/segment-save-as.png)

The new segment displays in the [!UICONTROL Segments] group in the [!UICONTROL Components] panel.

*`Save As`* is also available for the [!UICONTROL Calculated Metric Builder] and [!UICONTROL Date Range Builder].

## Add New Segment Button {#section_85CC88C02C79456EA2B41F2BFBB64FC4}

The **[!UICONTROL Add New Segment]** button has been added to the location where you drag-and-drop segments onto a project.

![](assets/add-new-segment.png)

This enhancement is helpful if you prefer to directly create segments when working in a project, rather than using the [!UICONTROL Segment] panel to create segments.

## Conditional Formatting {#section_5775B505D83041408B8C3EAEC5D7C32B}

In Column Settings, you can apply conditional formatting to cell data.

![](assets/conditional-formatting.png)

<table id="table_4285E6982FBD4B66AC95AAF6C5C7B347"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Element </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> Description </th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> Conditional Formatting </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p> Applies the following colors to cells, based on data values: </p> 
    <ul id="ul_97E3AD5F6B41460C882D8B4EE0A8C77A"> 
     <li id="li_88874B4250224DE781C03E4A5931D6A2">Green: high values </li>

    </ul> <p>Replacing a dimension in the table resets the conditional formatting limits. Replacing a metric recalculates the limits for that column (where a metric is on the X axis and a dimension is on the Y axis). </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> Auto-generated </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Automatically generates limits for conditional formatting. The upper limit is the largest value in this column. The lower limit is the lowest, and the midpoint is the average of the upper and lower limits. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> Custom </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>You can manually assign the values for the <span class="uicontrol"> Upper </span>, <span class="uicontrol"> Midpoint </span>, and <span class="uicontrol"> Lower Limit </span> fields for conditional formatting. This gives you the flexibility to determine when a column value becomes good, average, or poor. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

## Dimension Preview {#section_F519EBF889B244E8B25BB6BA2833325A}

In the [!UICONTROL Dimensions] component panel, you can hover over the information icon next to a dimension and see a top-five preview.

![](assets/dimension-preview.png)

## Legend Visible {#section_28D10D86CAE343AB838808C1DD2E7983}

In [!UICONTROL Visualization Settings] the **[!UICONTROL Legend Visible]** option shows or hides a visualization's legend.

![](assets/legend-visible.png)

## Anchor Y Axis at Zero {#section_83DF5DE79EF04F9F8DCB3154F5E799B3}

Depending on what the numbers are for a line and area charts, the bottom of the Y-axis might not be zero. Enabling **[!UICONTROL Anchor Y Axis at Zero]** in [!UICONTROL Visualization Settings] forces the Y-axis to zero, for a more accurate view of trends. The following examples show how a Revenue chart changes with this setting enabled and disabled:

**Anchor Y Axis at Zero Disabled**

![](assets/anchor_Y_axis_off.png)

**Anchor Y Axis at Zero Enabled**

![](assets/anchor_Y_axis.png)

## Project Name on Tab Title {#section_497C61A030984BCCA2CEA553312C3226}

When saving a project, the title on the browser tab will be displayed as "`<Project Name>` - Analysis Workspace". This enhancement is helpful if you open multiple projects in multiple browser tabs.

## Transfer Project Ownership {#section_989C2CCB80B5408EB85E6B12C8D943E3}

Administrators can transfer [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace] projects from one user to another.

Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL User Management]** > **[!UICONTROL Transfer]** to transfer projects.
