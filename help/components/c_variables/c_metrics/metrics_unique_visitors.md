# Unique Visitors

In version 14, a unique visitor refers to a visitor who visits a site for the first time within a specified time period. For example, the unique visitor can visit a site ten times in a week, but if the time period is week, a single unique visitor is counted only once for that week. After that week is ended, that unique visitor can be counted again for a different time period.

 **Differences between version 14 and 15 **

version 14 does not remove duplicate [!UICONTROL Visits] and [!UICONTROL Unique Visitors] metrics from classifications-based reports. For example, if two video clips shared the same classification, a single visitor that viewed both clips generated two [!UICONTROL Visits] and [!UICONTROL Unique Visitors] in the classification-based report.

Version 15 removes duplicate [!UICONTROL Visits] and [!UICONTROL Unique Visitors] from the classification-based report. This is a more accurate measure of [!UICONTROL Visits] and [!UICONTROL Visitors], but typically results in a decrease in your [!UICONTROL Visits] and [!UICONTROL Unique Visitors] metrics for classification-based reports, when compared to data collected prior to upgrade.
