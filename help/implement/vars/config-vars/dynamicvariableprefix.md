# dynamicVariablePrefix

Dynamic variables are a shorthand concept that let you copy values from one variable to another. They are valuable for long variable values, as they help shorten an image request's URL length. See [Dynamic variables](../page-vars/dynamic-variables.md) for more information on this concept.

By default, dynamic variables use the prefix `D=`. The `dynamicVariablePrefix` variable lets you customize the string that identifies dynamic variables. It is case-sensitive.

## Dynamic Variable Prefix in Adobe Experience Platform Launch

Dynamic Variable Prefix is a field under the [!UICONTROL Global Variables] accordion when configuring the Adobe Analytics extension.

1. Log in to [launch.adobe.com](https://launch.adobe.com) using your AdobeID credentials.
2. Click the desired property.
3. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click the [!UICONTROL Configure] button under Adobe Analytics.
4. Expand the [!UICONTROL Global Variables] accordion, which reveals the [!UICONTROL Dynamic Variable Prefix] field.

This field contains `D=` by default. You can change the value if you want to use a different dynamic variable prefix. You can use any value you want, as long as it matches the character encoding on your site.

## s.dynamicVariablePrefix in AppMeasurement and Launch custom code editor

The `s.dynamicVariablePrefix` variable is a string that can contain any sequence of characters. If this variable is not defined, AppMeasurement uses the string `D=` by default.

```js
// An example that changes the dynamic variable prefix
s.dynamicVariablePrefix="..";

// This eVar uses the above customized dynamic variable prefix to set eVar to page URL
s.eVar1="..g";
```
