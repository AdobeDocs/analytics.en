# Adobe Analytics landing page

The landing page for Adobe Analytics brings together both [!DNL Analysis Workspace] and [!DNL Reports & Analytics] (end-of-lifed) in a single interface and access point under the [!DNL Workspace] umbrella. It features a project manager home page, a templates section, and a learning section to help you with getting started more effectively. Here is a video overview:

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/334278/?quality=12)

The Adobe Analytics landing page is comprised of the following subtabs: Projects, Templates, and Learning.

**[!UICONTROL Projects]** are customized designs that combine data components, tables, and visualizations that you built or that someone else built and shared with you. [!UICONTROL Projects] also refers to blank projects and blank mobile scorecards.

**[!UICONTROL Templates]** includes templates provided by Adobe and any templates specific to your organization.

The **[!UICONTROL Learning]** tab contains hands-on video tours, tutorials, and links to documentation.

## Navigate the [!UICONTROL Projects] tab {#navigate-projects}

The [!UICONTROL Projects] tab serves as the [!UICONTROL Workspace] home page. It displays the Company folder, any personal folders you created, your projects, and Mobile scorecards. Use this page to view, create, and modify folders, projects, and mobile scorecards. For more information, see [About Folders in Analytics](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/workspace-folders/about-folders.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Several of the following settings persist during the session and across sessions. For example, the tab you selected, the selected filters, selected columns, and the column sort direction. Search results are not persistent.

### Customize table columns

To customize column widths, drag the vertical bar that separates each column. 

To add or remove columns from the list of projects, click the column icon (![Landing all](/help/analyze/assets/select-column.png) ) in the top-right, then select or deselect column titles. 

The available columns are:

| Column name | Description | 
|---------|----------|
| [!UICONTROL **Name**] | Identifies the name of the project. |
| [!UICONTROL **Type**] | Indicates whether this type is a Workspace project, a Mobile scorecard, or a folder. |
| [!UICONTROL **Tags**] | Tags projects to organize them into groups. | 
| [!UICONTROL **Scheduled**] | Set to [!UICONTROL On] when a project is scheduled or [!UICONTROL Off] when it is not. Clicking the [!UICONTROL On] link lets you see information about the scheduled project. You can also [edit the project schedule](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/curate-share/t-schedule-report.md) if you are the project owner. |
| [!UICONTROL **Project role**] | Identifies the project roles: whether you are the project Owner and whether you have permissions to Edit or Duplicate the project. |
| [!UICONTROL **Report suite**] | Identifies the Report Suites that are associated with the project.<br>Tables and visualizations within a panel derive data from the report suite selected in the top right of the panel. The report suite also determines what components are available in the left rail. Within a project, you can use one or many report suites depending on your analysis use cases. The list of report suites is sorted on relevance. Adobe defines relevance based on how recently and frequently the suite has been used by the current user, and how frequently the suite is used within the organization. |
| [!UICONTROL **Owner**] | Identifies the person who created the project. |
| [!UICONTROL **Shared With**] | Shows who the project is currently shared with. |
| [!UICONTROL **Last Modified**] | The date and time when the project was last modified. |
| [!UICONTROL **Last Opened**] | Identifies the date that a project was last opened by the user who is currently viewing the Projects page. |
| [!UICONTROL **Last Used**] | Helps determine whether a project is valuable to users in your organization by showing the date and time when the project was last opened by any user within the organization.<p>Consider the following when viewing this column:</p><ul><li>Usage information is available starting in September 2023.</li><li>This column is available only to system administrators.</li></ul> |
| [!UICONTROL **Project ID**] | Can be used for debugging projects. |
| [!UICONTROL **Longest Date Range**] | Longer date ranges increase project complexity and may increase processing and load times. |
| [!UICONTROL **Number of queries**] | The total number of requests made to Analytics when the project loads. A higher number of project queries increases project complexity and may increase processing and load times. This data is available only after a project has loaded or a scheduled project was sent. |
| [!UICONTROL **Location**] | Shows the folder where the project is located. |
