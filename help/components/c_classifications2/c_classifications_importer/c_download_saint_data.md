|  Export Numeric 2  |You can import numeric 2 classifications into the system via the importer. Numeric 2 classifications are useful for variables that change over time for different items, such as cost and budget values for the [!UICONTROL Marketing Channel] report. See [Numeric 2 Classifications](../../c_classifications2/c_numeric_2/c_numeric_2_classifications.md#concept_71024B7B91DF4E909076062AB1380D8B) for information about uploading data using numeric 2 classifications.  |
