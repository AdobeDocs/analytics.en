# Copy calculated metrics

When creating a new calculated metric, you do not have to start from scratch. You can copy an existing calculated metric that already provides a proper definition to start from, then modify the version you copied.

To copy a calculated metrics in the [Calculated metrics manager](cm-manager.md):

1. In the [Calculated metric manager](cm-manager.md), select one or more of the calculated metrics you want to copy.
1. From the action bar, select ![Copy](/help/assets/icons/Copy.svg) **[!UICONTROL Copy]**.

The new calculated metrics are created with the same name and suffix `(Copy)`.
