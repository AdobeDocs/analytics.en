# Segment Builder

The [!UICONTROL Segment Builder] lets you build simple or complex segments that identify visitor attributes and actions across visits and page hits. It provides a canvas to drag and drop metric dimensions, events, or other segments in order to segment visitors based on hierarchy logic, rules, and operators.

There are several ways to access the Segment Builder:

* **Analytics top navigation**: Click **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Components]** > **[!UICONTROL Segments]**.
* **[!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace]**: Click **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Workspace]**, open a project and click **[!UICONTROL + New]** > **[!UICONTROL Create Segment]**.
* **[!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics]**: Click **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Reports]**, open an existing report and click the Segments icon  ![](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Segmentation_18_N.svg) in the left navigation, then click **[!UICONTROL Add]**.
* **[!UICONTROL Report Builder]**: [Add or edit segments in Report Builder](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/report-builder/data-requests/segmentation.html).

## Builder criteria {#section_F61C4268A5974C788629399ADE1E6E7C}

You can add rule definitions and containers to define your segments.

![](assets/segment_builder_ui_2.png)

1. **[!UICONTROL Title]**: Name the segment.
1. **[!UICONTROL Description]**: Provide a description for the segment. 
1. **[!UICONTROL Tags]**: [Tag the segment](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-workflow.md) you are creating by picking from a list of existing tags or creating a new tag.
1. **[!UICONTROL Definitions]**: This is where you [build and configure segments](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-workflow.md), add rules, and nest and sequence containers. 
1. **[!UICONTROL Show]**: (Top Container selector.) Lets you select the top-level [container](/help/components/segmentation/seg-overview.md) ( [!UICONTROL Visitor], [!UICONTROL Visit], [!UICONTROL Hit]). The default top-level container is the Hit container.
1. **[!UICONTROL Options]**: (gear) icon

   * **[!UICONTROL + Add container]**: Lets you add a new container (below the top-level container) to the segment definition.
   * **[!UICONTROL Exclude]**: Lets you define the segment by excluding one or more dimensions, segments, or metrics.

1. **[!UICONTROL Dimensions]**: Components are dragged and dropped from the Dimensions list (orange sidebar).
1. **[!UICONTROL Operator]**: You can compare and constrain values using selected operators.
1. **[!UICONTROL Value]**: The value you entered or selected for the dimension or segment or metric.
1. **[!UICONTROL Attribution Models]**: Available for dimensions only, these models determine what values in a dimension to segment for. Dimension models are particularly useful in sequential segmentation.

   * **[!UICONTROL Repeating]** (default): Includes instances and persisted values for the dimension.
   * **[!UICONTROL Instance]**: Includes instances for the dimension.
   * **[!UICONTROL Non-repeating instance]**: Includes unique instances (non-repeating) for the dimension. This is the model applied in Flow when repeat instances are excluded.

   ![](assets/attribution-models.jpg)

      **Example: Hit segment where eVar1 = A** 

      |  Example  | A  | A  |  A (persisted) | B  | A  | C  |
      |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
      |  Repeating  | X  | X  | X  | -  | X  | -  |
      |  Instance  | X  | X  | - | - | X | - |
      |  Non-repeating instance  | X | - | - | -  | X  | -  |
1. **[!UICONTROL And/Or/Then]**: Assigns the [!UICONTROL AND/OR/THEN] operators between containers or rules. The THEN operator lets you [define sequential segments](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-sequential-build.md).
1. **[!UICONTROL Metric]**: (Green sidebar) Metric that was dragged and dropped from the Metrics list.
1. **[!UICONTROL Comparison]** operator: You can compare and constrain values using selected operators.
1. **[!UICONTROL Value]**: The value you entered or selected for the dimension or segment or metric.
1. **[!UICONTROL X]**: (Delete) Lets you delete this part of the segment definition.
1. **[!UICONTROL Experience Cloud publishing]**: Publishing an Adobe Analytics segment to the Experience Cloud lets you use the segment for marketing activity in [!DNL Audience Manager] and in other activation channels. [Learn more...](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-publish.md)
1. **[!UICONTROL Audience library]**: Adobe's audience services manage the translation of visitor data into audience segmentation. As such, creating and managing audiences is similar to creating and using segments, with the added ability to share the audience segment to the Experience Cloud. [Learn more...](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/core-services/interface/audiences/audience-library.html)
1. **[!UICONTROL Search]**: Searches the list of dimensions, segments, or metrics.
1. **[!UICONTROL Dimensions]**: (List) Click the header to expand.
1. **[!UICONTROL Metrics]**: Click the header to expand.
1. **[!UICONTROL Segments]**: Click the header to expand.
1. **[!UICONTROL Report suite selector]**: Lets you select the report suite that this segment will be saved under. You can still utilize the segment in all report suites.
1. **[!UICONTROL Segment Preview]**: Lets you preview the key metrics to see whether you have a valid segment and how broad the segment is. Represents the breakdown of the data set you can expect to see if you apply this segment. Shows 3 concentric circles and a list to show the number and percentage of matches for [!UICONTROL Hits], [!UICONTROL Visits], and [!UICONTROL Visitors] for a segment run against a data set. This chart is updated immediately after you create or make changes to your segment definition.
1. **[!UICONTROL Product Compatibility]**: Provides a list of which Adobe Analytics products (Analysis Workspace, [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics], Data Warehouse) with which the segment you created is compatible. Most segments are compatible with all products. However, not all operators and dimensions are compatible with all Analytics products, especially [Data Warehouse](/help/components/segmentation/seg-reference/seg-compatibility.md). This chart is updated immediately after you make changes to your segment definition.
1. **[!UICONTROL Save]** or **[!UICONTROL Cancel]**: Saves or cancels the segment. After clicking **[!UICONTROL Save]**, you are taken to the Segment Manager where you can manage the segment.

Segments with embedded date ranges continue to operate differently in Analysis Workspace versus [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics]: In Workspace, a segment with an embedded date range overrides the panel date range. By contrast, [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics] gives you the intersection of the report date range and the segment's embedded date range.

## Build segments {#build-segments}

1. Simply drag a Dimension, Segment, or Metric Event from the left pane to the [!UICONTROL Definitions] field.

   ![](assets/drag_n_drop_dimension.png)

   The default top-level [!UICONTROL Hit] container is shown after dragging an element to [!UICONTROL Definitions]. You can change the container type to Visit or Visitor from the **[!UICONTROL Show]** drop-down menu.

1. Set the [operator](/help/components/segmentation/seg-reference/seg-operators.md) from the drop-down menu.
1. Enter or select a value for the item selected.
1. Add additional containers if needed, using **[!UICONTROL And]**, **[!UICONTROL Or]**, or **[!UICONTROL Then]** rules.
1. After placing the containers and setting the rules, see the results of the segment in the validation chart at the top right. The validator indicates the percentage and absolute number of page views, visits, and unique visitors that match the segment you created.
1. Under **[!UICONTROL Tags]**, [tag](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-tag.md) the container by selecting an existing tag or creating a new one.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save the segment.

You are now taken to the [Segment Manager](/help/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-manage.md), where you can tag, share, and manage your segment in multiple ways.

## Add containers {#section_1C38F15703B44474B0718CEF06639EFD}

You can [build a framework of containers](/help/components/segmentation/seg-overview.md) and then place logic rules and operators between.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Options > Add Container]**.

   ![](assets/add_container.png)

   A new [!UICONTROL Hit] container opens without a [!UICONTROL Hit] (Page View) identified.

   ![](assets/new_container.png)

1. Change the container type as needed.
1. Drag a Dimension, Segment, or Event from the left pane to the container.
1. Continue to add new containers from the top-level **[!UICONTROL Options]** > **[!UICONTROL Add container]** button at the top of the definition, or add containers from within a container to nest logic.

   **OR**

   Select one or more rules and then click **[!UICONTROL Options]** > **[!UICONTROL Add container from selection]**. This turns your selection into a separate container.

## Use date ranges {#concept_252A83D43B6F4A4EBAB55F08AB2A1ACE}

You can build segments that contain rolling date ranges in order to answer questions about ongoing campaigns or events.

For example, you can easily build a segment that includes "everyone who has made a purchase over the past 60 days".

You create a Visit container and within it, add the [!UICONTROL Last 60 days] time range and the metric [!UICONTROL Orders is greater than or equal to 1], with an AND operator:

![](assets/date-ranges.png)

Here is a video on using rolling date ranges in segments:

## Stack segments {#task_58140F17FFD64FF1BC30DC7B0A1B0E6D}

Stacking segments works by combining the criteria in each segment using an 'and' operator, and then applying the combined criteria. This can be done in a Workspace project directly or in segment builder. 

For example, stacking a "mobile phone users" segment and a "US geography" segment would return data only for mobile phone users in the US.

Think of these segments as building blocks or modules that you can include in a segment library, for users to use as they see fit. That way, you can dramatically reduce the number of segments needed. For example, assume you have 40 segments:

* 20 for mobile phone users in different countries (US_mobile, Germany_mobile, France_mobile, Brazil_mobile, etc.) 
* 20 for tablet users in different countries (US_tablet, Germany_tablet, France_tablet, Brazil_tablet, etc.)

By using segment stacking, you can reduce your segment count to 22 and stack them as needed. You would need to create these segments:

* one segment for mobile users 
* one segment for tablet users 
* 20 segments for the different geographies

>[!NOTE]
>
>When stacking two segments, they are by default joined by an AND statement. This cannot be changed to an OR statement.

1. Go to the Segment Builder.
1. Provide a title and description for the segment.

   Step Result 1. Click **[!UICONTROL Show Segments]** to bring up the list of segments in the left navigation.

   Step Result 1. Drag and drop the segments you want to stack to the segment definition canvas. Here is an example of a segment that stacks the existing segments "Visits from Tablets" and "US Geo":

   ![](assets/seg_stack2.png)

1. Save the segment.

## Segment templates {#concept_5098446CC78D441E93B8E4D1D1EA6558}

Segment templates are provided for common segmentation use cases, such as "First-time Visits" or "Vists from Mobile Devices". They are available in Workspace projects and in the segment builder as building blocks for new segments. 

Templates are denoted by the Adobe "A" logo. A sample of the templates are listed below:
