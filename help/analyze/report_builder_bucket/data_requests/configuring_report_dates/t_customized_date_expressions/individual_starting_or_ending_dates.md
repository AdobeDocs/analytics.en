# Individual starting or ending dates


* cd-1d = yesterday
* cm-1d = last day of last month
* cw-1w = first day of last week
* cw+1w-1d = last day of the current week
* cd-2d = two days ago
* cw-2w = first day the week, two weeks ago


Note that setting the date to a future date does not return values for future dates.
