# Report time processing

Report time processing is a virtual report suite setting that allows data to be processed in a non-destructive, retroactive fashion.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Report Time Processing is available only for Analysis Workspace.

Report Time Processing only affects the data in the virtual report suite and does not impact any data or data collection in the base report suite. The difference between Report Time Processing and traditional Analytics processing is best understood using the following diagram:

During Analytics data processing, data flows through the data collection pipeline and into a preprocessing step, which prepares data for reporting. This preprocessing step applies visit expiration logic and eVar persistence logic (among other things) to the data as it is collected. The primary disadvantage of this preprocessing model is that it requires any configuration be done in advance before data is collected. This means that any changes to preprocessing settings apply only to new data from that time forward. This is problematic if data arrives out of order or if settings were misconfigured.

Report Time Processing is a fundamentally different way of processing Analytics data for reporting. Instead of predetermining processing logic before data is collected, Analytics ignores the data set during the preprocessing step and applies this logic each time a report is run:

This processing architecture allows for far more flexible reporting options. For example, you can change the visit timeout period to any length of time you want in a non-destructive way and those changes are reflected in your eVar persistence and segment containers retroactively as if you had applied those settings before the data was collected. Additionally, you can create any number of virtual report suites, each with different Report Time Processing options based on the same base report suite, without altering any of the data in the base report suite.

Report Time Processing also allows Analytics to prevent background hits from starting new visits and allows the [mobile SDK](https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/get-started/mobile/c-measuring-mobile-applications) to tell reporting to start a new visit whenever an App Launch event is triggered.

The following configuration options are currently available to virtual report suites with Report Time Processing enabled:

   <td colname="col1"> <p> Visit Timeout </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p> The visit timeout setting defines the amount of inactivity a unique visitor must have before a new visit is automatically started. It defaults to 30 minutes. For example, if you set the visit timeout to 15 minutes, a new visit grouping is created for each sequence of hits collected, separated by 15 minutes of inactivity. This setting impacts not only your visit counts, but also how visit segment containers are evaluated, and the visit expiration logic for any eVars expiring on visit. Decreasing the visit timeout will likely increase the total number of visits in your reporting, while increasing the visit timeout will likely decrease the total number of visits in your reporting. </p> </td>

Report Time Processing does not support all metrics and dimensions available in traditional Analytics reporting. Virtual report suites utilizing Report Time Processing are only accessible in Analysis Workspace and will not be accessible in Reports & Analytics, Ad Hoc Analysis, Data Warehouse, Report Builder, Data Feeds, or the reporting API.

In addition, Report Time Processing only processes data that comes from within the reporting date range (referred to as "date windowing" below). This means that eVar values set to "never expire" for a visitor prior to the reporting date range do not persist into the reporting windows and do not appear in reports. This also means that customer loyalty measurements are based exclusively on the data present in the reporting date range and not on the entire history prior to the reporting date range.

Below is a list of metrics and dimensions that are not currently supported when using Report Time Processing :
