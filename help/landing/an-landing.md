# Unified Analytics - the new Adobe Analytics landing page

Unified Analytics is a new landing page for Adobe Analysis. It brings together both Analysis Workspace and Reports & Analytics in a single interface and access point under the Workspace umbrella. It features a new project manager home page, an updated reports menu and modernized reports, as well as a new learning section to help you with getting started more effectively.

This page is currently in Open Beta and is an optional starting point. If you prefer, you may use your existing landing page, whether that is Workspace or Reports.
