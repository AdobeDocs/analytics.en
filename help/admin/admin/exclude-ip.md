## Exclude By Cookie {#section_FB5A20AB5E514DA6BC596CC67F6A3A4C}

Lets you exclude this computer from being tracked in your account. If you choose to exclude your computer, any data generated from your computer is not counted.

This feature allows you and your colleagues to visit your site without skewing your traffic data. You may want to use this feature if you do not have a static IP address (such as having a dial-up Internet connection through a service provider) and would like to exclude yourself from your account data.

## Exclude by IP Address {#section_609FB6461529409D840111A32FEF5C3D}

An IP address is an Internet address. All Internet users are assigned numerical IP addresses (typically through Internet service providers) that effectively act as electronic identifiers.

Page views are counted and unique page visitors are identified through IP addresses. By excluding IP addresses from being counted, you can prevent Adobe from tracking frequent visitors. This feature can allow you and your colleagues to visit your site without skewing your traffic data. You may exclude up to 50 different IP addresses.

You can use wildcard indicators (&#42;) to exclude a range of addresses. For example, [!DNL 0.0.*.0] would exclude all IP addresses between [!DNL 0.0.0.0] and [!DNL 0.0.255.0]. You may exclude up to 50 different IP addresses.

## Exclude by Firewall {#section_3E7BFB71ADD941D39F923DB9557AD9CD}

You can also block data collection from specific IP addresses via a firewall.

See the [IP Addresses Used in the Experience Cloud](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/home/index.html#kb-adobe-ip-addresses) article.

## Impact of IP Obfuscation {#section_51B7529FFF16449CA016FDC51D87E2CA}

If IP obfuscation is enabled, IP exclusion happens before the IP address is obfuscated, so customers donâ€™'t need to change anything when they enable IP obfuscation.

If the last octet is removed, that is done before IP filtering. As such, the last octet is replaced with a 0, and IP exclusion rules should be updated to match IP addresses with a zero on the end. Matching &#42; should match 0.
