# Escalate issues to Customer Care

Some issues require immediate attention by Adobe. Use this process to report incidents that are not actioned within a reasonable timeframe relative to its severity.

Send an email to [dmaEscalations@adobe.com](mailto:dmaescalations@adobe.com) with the following information:

* The incident number that you want to escalate
* The business justification for escalation

This email alias alerts several teams, including Customer Care management, of your escalation. Typical response time is 1 hour in most situations.

## Create P1 issues with Customer Care

If you have a high-priority issue that requires Adobe's immediate attention, use phone or chat methods to contact Customer Care. The Adobe representative can create a P1 issue and involve the appropriate teams.

If you create a P1 incdient through email, Adobe follows a triage process that provides an initial response within 1 hour. If you don't receive additional responses within 6 hours for these incidents, use the above escalation process.

## Involvement with Account Managers

As a general rule, escalating through your Account Manager is not necessary. If your Account Manager needs to get involved, Customer Care will loop them in on the conversation. You are welcome to CC your Account Manager in email communication around escalated Customer Care incidents.
