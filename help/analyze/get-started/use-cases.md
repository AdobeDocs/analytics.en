## Attribution

Attribution lets organizations see how different interactions throughout the customer journey affect conversion. In addition to providing more traditional attribution options, such as Linear or First Touch models, Attribution in Adobe Analytics also uses machine learning and advanced statistical models to understand the precise impact of every touch.

For more information, see [Attribution models and lookback windows](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/attribution/models.md).

## Predictive analytics

Predictive analytics uses machine learning and advanced statistical modeling to analyze customer data, find patterns, and predict future behavior such as churn or a likelihood to convert. It allows data analysts to take advantage of huge data sets that might otherwise be wasted.

The following key features in Adobe Analytics provide these predictive capabilities:

* [Anomaly detection](#anomaly-detection)
