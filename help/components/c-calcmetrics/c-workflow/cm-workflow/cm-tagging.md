# Tag calculated metrics

In the Calculated metric manager, you can organize segments by tagging them.

All users can create tags for calculated metrics and apply one or more tags to a metric. However, you can see tags only for those calculated metrics that you own or that have been shared with you. 

>[!TIP]
>
>The most useful types of tags are usually tags that are based on the following criteria:
>
>* **Team names**, such as Social Marketing or Mobile Marketing.
>* **Projects** (analysis tags), such as Entry-page analysis.
>* **Categories**, such as Women's or Geography.
>* **Workflows**, such as To be approved or Curated for (a specific business unit)
