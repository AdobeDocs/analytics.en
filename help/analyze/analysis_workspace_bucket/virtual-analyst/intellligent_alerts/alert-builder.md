# Alert Builder

Access the Alert Builder in one of four ways: 

* By using the following shortcut in Analysis Workspace: ` ctrl (or cmd) + shift + a` 

* By going to ** [!UICONTROL  Workspace] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  Components] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  New Alert] **.
* By selecting one or more freeform table line items, right-clicking and selecting ** [!UICONTROL  Create Alert from Selection] **.
* From within a Reports &amp; Analytics report, by going to ** [!UICONTROL  More] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  Add Alert] **.
The Alert Builder interface is familiar to those who have built segments or calculated metrics in Analytics:

## Alert preview {#section_10D75BA7B77E4C5FAF58A719C082E070}

The interactive alert preview shows you how often, approximately, an alert will fire based on past experience. 

For example, if you set the time granularity to daily, the preview can tell you that the alert would have been triggered for a certain metric x times during the last 30 or 31 days. 

If you find that too many alerts would have been triggered, you can adjust the threshold in the [ Alert Manager](../../../analysis_workspace_bucket/virtual-analyst/intellligent_alerts/alert-manager.md#concept_633AE746900B44D2A7045386B526ED8D).
