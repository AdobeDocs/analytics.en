# Analysis Workspace overview

>This page is currently under construction.

Analysis Workspace removes all of the typical limitations of a single Analytics report. It provides a robust, flexible canvas for building custom analysis projects. Drag-and-drop any number of data tables, visualizations, and components (dimensions, metrics, segments, and time granularities) to a project. Instantly create breakdowns and segments, create cohorts for analysis, create alerts, compare segments, do flow and fallout analysis, and curate and schedule reports for sharing with anyone in your business. 

This page contains basic instructions to get you started. When you have mastered the basics, you can move on to the advanced features of Workspace. They  include [Attribution IQ](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/attribution/overview.md), [Anomaly Detection](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/virtual-analyst/c-anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection.md), [Contribution Analysis](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/virtual-analyst/contribution-analysis/ca-tokens.md), [Segment IQ](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/segment-iq.md), and [Intelligent Alerts](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/c-intelligent-alerts/intellligent-alerts.md).

### Step 1: Analyze a dimension

Use definitions & examples that we have in the training tutorial - this feedback applies to all remaining steps

### Step 2: Add a metric

Touch on adding calculated metrics in this section
 
### Step 3: Change the date range

### Step 4: Break down a dimension

### Step 5: Apply a segment to your data

### Step 6: Add basic visualizations 

Share a tip about "quick viz" in this section

### Step 7: Explore advanced visualizations

Highlight Flow, Fallout, Cohort, Map
