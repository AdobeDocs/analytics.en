# Work with text in windows

Wherever you can enter text in a window, you can perform many of the functions that you can perform in any text editor, such as Notepad or Microsoft Word.

 [!DNL Data workbench] supports basic editing features, including cut (Ctrl+x), copy (Ctrl+c), paste (Ctrl+v), undo (Ctrl+z), redo (Ctrl+Shift+z), select section (click+drag), and select all (Ctrl+a).

In addition to basic copying and pasting of text, you can copy and paste text within and between configuration files ( [!DNL .cfg]).

**To copy and paste parameters and nodes within a configuration file ([!DNL .cfg])**

When copying and pasting a parameter, both must be of the same type, such as string to string.

1. Right-click a node or parameter label and click **[!UICONTROL Copy]**. 
1. Complete one of the following steps:

    * Right-click the vector and click **[!UICONTROL Paste as child]**. The node is pasted above the first node in the vector. 
    * Right-click the node below which you want to paste the node and click **[!UICONTROL Paste]**.

**To copy and paste nodes into a text editor**

1. Right-click a vector or node and click **[!UICONTROL Copy]**. 
1. In the appropriate location within the text editor file, press **[!UICONTROL Ctrl+v]**.
