# Rotate FTP account secrets (passwords) for Data Feeds and Data Warehouse 
 
Adobe recommends that you periodically rotate the account secrets (passwords) on your FTP accounts that are associated with Data Feeds and Data Warehouse. 
 
Regular rotation of account secrets is a security best practice that helps protect your data. 
 
To ensure uninterrupted reception of data, follow the steps in [Prepare to rotate account secrets](#prepare-to-rotate-account-secrets) prior to changing any account secrets.  
 
>[!IMPORTANT] 
> 
>If your FTP data is delivered to a third-party partner (for example, a consulting firm or Analytics vendor), coordinate with them before rotating account secrets. The third-party partner will need to update their own tools and scripts with the new account secrets immediately after the new account secrets are provided by your FTP host provider (either Adobe or another provider).

## When rotating account secrets is not necessary 
 
### Transition from FTP to a cloud destination 
 
FTP and SFTP are legacy destination types. Rather than rotating FTP account secrets, Adobe recommends moving to a modern cloud destination type (such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Platform, or Azure), which are more secure. For more information, see [Configure cloud import and export accounts](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/components/locations/configure-import-accounts). 
 
### Transition from the Classifications importer to Classification sets 
 
If your FTP account is used exclusively for Classifications, you should migrate from the **Classifications importer** to **Classification sets**, rather than rotating your FTP account secrets. The Classification importer will be deprecated on **August 31, 2026**. For more information, see [Classification sets overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/components/classifications/sets/overview). 

## Prepare to rotate account secrets 
 
Complete the following steps before attempting to rotate FTP account secrets: 
 
### Step 1: Inventory your FTP accounts 
 
Identify all FTP accounts that are receiving data for Data Feeds or Data Warehouse. This information is shown in your FTP configuration settings, as described in the [Legacy account types](/help/components/locations/configure-import-accounts.md#configure-a-location-account) section of the article [Configure cloud import and export accounts](/help/components/locations/configure-import-accounts.md). 
 
For each account, gather the following information: 
 
* **Host**: The FTP destination of the host your account connects to (for example, `ftp.omniture.com`, `ftp2.omniture.com`, and so forth). 
 
* **Port**: SFTP clients connect on port 22. FTP connections that are non-secure use port 21. 
 
* **Username**: The username used to log in to the FTP site. 
 
* **location account secret**: The current account secret for the account. This is the account secret (password) that you use currently when downloading data delivered to your FTP location. This information is not available from the Analytics interface. 
 
 
### Step 2: Confirm that you can update credentials in your tools 
 
Make sure you can update the FTP account secret in whatever tool or script you use to connect to the FTP site (for example, an FTP client, automated script, or third-party platform). 
 
### Step 3: Create FTP cloud location accounts with your current credentials 
 
Create new FTP cloud location accounts to replace your existing FTP accounts. These new accounts will be used as the destination for your Data Feeds and Data Warehouse deliveries.  
 
When creating the new FTP accounts, you must use the same hostname, username, and account secret that are used in your existing FTP accounts. 
 
#### Create each FTP account 
 
1. In Adobe Analytics, go to **Components** > **Locations**. 
 
1. Select the **Location accounts** tab. 
 
1. Select **Add account**. 
 
1. In the **Account type** drop-down field, select **FTP (legacy)**. 
 
1. Complete the following fields: 

   | Field name | Function |
   |---------|----------|
   | **Hostname** |  Your Adobe FTP host name (for example, `ftp.omniture.com`). | 
   | **Port** | SFTP clients connect on port 22. FTP connections that are non-secure use port 21. | 
   | **Username** | Your current FTP username. |
   | **Location account secret** | Your current FTP account secrets (password).  |
 
1. Select **Save**. 
 
Repeat this process for each FTP account. 
 
For detailed instructions, see [Configure cloud import and export accounts](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/components/locations/configure-import-accounts). 
 
#### Add a location within the account 
 
1. On the **Locations** tab, select **Add location**. 
 
1. Specify a name, description, and whether this location will be used with Data Feeds or Data Warehouse. 
 
1. In the [!UICONTROL **Location account**] field, select the account you just created. 
 
1. In the [!UICONTROL **Directory path**] field, specify the path to the directory on the FTP server. Folders must already exist; feeds throw an error if the specified path does not exist. For example, `/folder_name/folder_name`. 
 
1. Select **Save**. 
 
Repeat this process for each location. 
 
For detailed instructions, see [Configure cloud import and export locations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/components/locations/configure-import-locations). 
 
### Step 4: Reference the new FTP cloud accounts from any scheduled Data Feeds and Data Warehouse requests 
 
Update any existing scheduled Data Feeds and Data Warehouse requests to use the FTP cloud accounts you created.  
 
* **Data Feeds**: Go to **Admin** > **Data Feeds**, edit each scheduled  Data Feed that uses an FTP account, then change the destination to the newly created FTP cloud account. 
 
  For detailed instructions, see [Edit a data feed](/help/export/analytics-data-feed/df-manage-feeds.md#edit-a-data-feed) in [Manage data feeds](/help/export/analytics-data-feed/df-manage-feeds.md). 
 
* **Data Warehouse**: Go to **Tools** > **Data Warehouse**, edit each scheduled Data Warehouse request that uses an FTP account, then change the report destination to the newly created FTP cloud account. 
 
  For detailed instructions, see [Edit requests](/help/export/data-warehouse/data-warehouse-requests-manage.md#edit-requests) in [Manage Data Warehouse requests](/help/export/data-warehouse/data-warehouse-requests-manage.md). 
 
### Step 5: Ensure that scheduled Data Feeds and Data Warehouse requests are being delivered correctly. 
 
After updating each existing Data Feed and Data Warehouse request to use the new FTP account and location, wait for the next scheduled delivery. Verify that data arrives at the new destination as expected. 

## Request a new account secret 
 
>[!IMPORTANT] 
>
>Before requesting a new account secret, consider the following:
>
>* The steps in this section apply only if you are using an Adobe-provided FTP account. For example, the FTP hostname is `ftp.omniture.com`, `ftp2.omniture.com` or similar.   If your FTP hostname is not provided by Adobe, please contact your FTP host provider for details on changing the account secret.
> 
>* Request a new account secret only after you complete all the preparation steps described in [Prepare to rotate account secrets](#prepare-to-rotate-account-secrets). 
>
>* After Adobe Customer Care or your third-party FTP host provider provides a new account secret, the old account secret is immediately invalidated. There is no way to revert to the previous account secret. 
>
 
To request a new account secret from Adobe: 
 
1. Contact Adobe Customer Care. 
 
1. For each FTP account, provide the **Hostname** and **Username** for each account that needs a new account secret. 
 
   Customer Care will generate a new account secret for each FTP account. 

1. Continue immediately with the following section, [After you receive the new account secret](#after-you-receive-the-new-account-secret).
 
## After you receive the new account secret 
 
Act immediately after receiving the new credentials. Any delay results in failed deliveries for active Data Feeds and Data Warehouse requests. 
 
### Step 1: Update your tools and scripts 
 
Update the FTP account secret in any tool, script, or automated process that connects to the FTP account. Make sure all team members and third-party partners who access the account are notified. 
 
### Step 2: Update your cloud location accounts 
 
1. In Adobe Analytics, go to **Components** > **Locations**. 

1. Select the **Location accounts** tab. 

1. Find the FTP account that you created in Step 3 of section, [Prepare to rotate account secrets](#prepare-to-rotate-account-secrets).

1. Select **Edit details**. 

1. Enter the new account secret and confirm it. 

1. Select **Save**. 
 
Repeat this process for each account that was reset. 

For more detailed information about this process, see [Configure cloud import and export accounts](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/components/locations/configure-import-accounts).
 
### Step 3: Test your connections 
 
Verify that your Data Feeds or Data Warehouse requests that use the FTP account are working correctly with the new account secret. 
 
>[!TIP] 
> 
>If your current tools use SFTP with SSH keys that haven't been recently rotated, consider rotating those keys as well.
 
## Troubleshooting 
 
If something goes wrong after the account secret is rotated and you cannot restore connectivity, you can create a new FTP account. After the new account is set up, point your Data Feed or Data Warehouse request to the new account and update your cloud location accordingly.
