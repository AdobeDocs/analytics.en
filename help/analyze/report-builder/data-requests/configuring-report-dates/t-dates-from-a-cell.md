# Dates from a cell

You can specify a date range by selecting cells from a worksheet that contains a request. Report builder uses the specific date range information in those requests. If you select today's date, you see partial data based on the time of day the request runs.

 **To configure dates from a cell** 

1. On the [!UICONTROL Request Wizard: Step 1], select **[!UICONTROL Dates From Cell]**.
1. Enter cell references in the **[!UICONTROL From]** and **[!UICONTROL To]** fields, or click the selector and select the cells containing the requests with the starting and ending dates.
For example, create a Report Builder request with the date range set to "yesterday" and output the request date in the same cell as "today()-1".
