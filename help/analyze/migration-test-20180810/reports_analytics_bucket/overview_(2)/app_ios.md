You can view trend data by day, week, or month, or up to 90 days. The clear, simple-to-use interface lets you quickly access and present trend data reports of up to three metrics. 

Download Adobe Analytics for iOS from the App Store. If your iPad requires a newer version of the iOS, you can use iTunes to download the update. Always use the latest version of iTunes for best results.
