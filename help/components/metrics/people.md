# People

The 'People' metric counts the number of people, or groups of devices, based on Adobe's Device Graph. It is a more accurate representation of the number of [Unique visitors](unique-visitors.md). Use of this metric requires using a [Device graph](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/device-co-op/using/data/people.html) or [Cross-device analytics](../cda/overview.md).
