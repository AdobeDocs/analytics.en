# Analysis Workspace overview

Analysis Workspace is a flexible browser tool that allows you to quickly build analyses and share insights. Using the drag-and-drop interface, you can craft your analysis, add visualizations to bring data to life, curate a dataset, share and schedule projects with anyone in your organization.

If you have only a few minutes, watch this brief overview to see what is possible.

## Use the Training tutorial {#training-tutorial}

To begin the tutorial, click **[!UICONTROL Create New Project]** and then select **Training Tutorial** within the new project modal.

## Create a new project {#new-project}

With the tutorial complete, you are ready to begin building your first project. The **new project modal** provides you with different options for starting your analysis. You can choose to start from a blank project or [blank mobile scorecard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/ analytics/analyze/mobapp/curator.html), depending on whether you plan to share your analysis from the browser or the Adobe Analytics dashboards mobile app.

You can also begin your analysis from pre-built **templates**, either Adobe-provided standard templates or custom templates that were created by your organization. There a several different templates available, depending on the analysis or use case you have in mind. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/ analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/starter-projects.html) about the different template options available.

## Build your analysis {#analysis}

In your Workspace project, **panels, tables, visualizations, and components** are accessed from the left rail. These are your project building blocks.

### Components

**Components** are dimensions, metrics, segments, or date ranges, all of which can be combined in a **[!UICONTROL Freeform table]** to start answering your business question. Be sure to familiarize yourself with each [component type](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/analysis-workspace-components.md) before diving into your analysis. Once you've mastered component terminology, you can begin dragging and dropping to [build your analysis](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/ analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/t-freeform-project.html) in a **[!UICONTROL Freeform table]**.

### Visualizations

**Visualizations**, such as a bar or line chart, are then added on top of the data to visually bring it to life. On the far left rail, select the middle **[!UICONTROL Visualizations]** icon to see the full list of [visualizations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/ analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-analysis-visualizations.html) available.
