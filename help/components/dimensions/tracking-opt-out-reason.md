# Tracking opt-out reason

*This page refers to the dimension that lets you see potential data impact from enabling certain Report Suite settings. It is not related to the [Adobe Experience Cloud ID Opt-in Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/implementation/opt-in-service/optin-overview.html).*

The 'Tracking opt-out reason' dimension acts as a preview to data that would be excluded if you enabled Privacy Settings. This dimension is primarily used to determine if your implementation would be negatively impacted if you enabled [Privacy Settings](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/core-services/interface/administration/ec-cookies/browser-cookie-settings.html) under Report Suite Settings.

Typical implementations see 1% or less of their overall report suite traffic under this dimension if Privacy Settings have not yet been enabled. Percentages higher than 1% of all traffic suggests a potential implementation problem that prevents AppMeasurement from setting first-party cookies.

## Populate this dimension with data

This dimension works out of the box for all implementations that have not yet enabled [Privacy Settings](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/core-services/interface/administration/ec-cookies/browser-cookie-settings.html). If your organization has already enabled the **[!UICONTROL Remove users who have blocked all cookies]** setting for both desktop and mobile browsers, this dimension does not contain data.

## Dimension items
