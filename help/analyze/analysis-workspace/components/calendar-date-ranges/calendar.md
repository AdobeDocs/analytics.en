# Calendar and date ranges overview

In the calendar, you can specify dates and date ranges, or select a preset.

Calendar selections apply at the panel level, but you have the option to apply them to all panels. By default, the Workspace calendar shows the current month and last month.

The first click starts a date range selection. Then highlight the range in either direction until the second click, which selects the end of the date range. If the `Shift` key is held down (or right-click is used) while clicking the first date, it will append to the range.

You can also drag dates (and time dimensions) into a Workspace project. You can select specific days, weeks, months, years, or a rolling date.
