# How processing rules work

Processing rules let you make changes to data based on defined conditions. When attributes or values match defined conditions, values can be set and deleted, and events can be set.

Processing rules are applied to data as it is collected, and rules are applied to all data that comes through the AppMeasurement libraries and through the Data Insertion API. Processing rules also apply to the full and log data sources. These sources contain data that represents a *`hit`* or an action that a user takes. Processing rules do not apply to other data sources.

## Important Concepts {#section_EB138775E7C64C74B0D1D3213F7A823C}

The following table contains key concepts you need to understand when using processing rules:

## Processing Rule Conditions {#section_387390EEE9BA4DA98698522A84326DB4}

Conditions check page variables for a matching value or if a value is present. Multiple conditions can be added and you can select if all conditions must be matched.

You can create a rule with no conditions to always execute defined actions.

Variables are not automatically checked for values before actions occur. For example, Prop1 contains a value of "something", and eVar1 is empty. If you set Prop1 to equal eVar1 both values will be empty. If you need to avoid this add a condition to check for the presence of a value.

## Processing Rule Actions {#section_E2285C9D008442C7BF136E52A9A4CC06}

Actions set page variables, delete page variables, or trigger events. Actions can also concatenate values to display in a report.

For example, you might want to display `category:product` by concatenating two variables.
