# Adobe Analytics overview

Adobe Analytics enables organizations to gather data and gain actionable insights from any digital customer interaction. With in-depth analysis, versatile reporting, and predictive intelligence, organizations get the insightful foundation they need to build better experiences for their customers. 

## Key benefits

Following are some of the key ways that Adobe Analytics helps organizations gain critical insights in order to better serve their customers.

For additional details about the benefits that Adobe Analytics provides, see the [Adobe Analytics product page](https://business.adobe.com/products/analytics/adobe-analytics.html).

+++Web analytics

Adobe Analytics provides the following complex segmentation and predictive tools for analyzing website traffic:

* [Ad hoc analysis in Analysis Workspace](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.md)

* [Flow analysis](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/c-flow/flow.md)

* [Advanced segmentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/segmentation/seg-home.html)

+++

+++Marketing analytics

Adobe Analytics helps organizations understand where customers interact with their brands, which channels customers prefer, and which experiences resonate with them. 

The following key features in Adobe Analytics provide these marketing capabilities:

* Multichannel data collection

* [Offline data integration](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/import/data-sources/overview.html?lang=en)

* [Ad hoc analysis in Analysis Workspace](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.md)

+++

+++Attribution

Attribution lets organizations see how different interactions throughout the customer journey affect conversion. In addition to providing more traditional attribution options, such as Linear or First Touch models, Attribution in Adobe Analytics also uses machine learning and advanced statistical models to understand the precise impact of every touch.

For more information, see [Attribution models and lookback windows](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/attribution/models.md).

+++


+++Predictive analytics

Predictive analytics uses machine learning and advanced statistical modeling to analyze customer data, find patterns, and predict future behavior such as churn or a likelihood to convert. It allows data analysts to take advantage of huge data sets that might otherwise be wasted.

The following key features in Adobe Analytics provide these predictive capabilities:

* [Anomaly detection](#anomaly-detection)

* [Contribution analysis](#contribution-analysis)

* [Intelligent alerts](#intelligent-alerts)

+++

## Prerequisites for using Adobe Analytics

Before you can use Adobe Analytics, you must have:

* A valid Adobe Analytics license

  Adobe Analytics requires a site license. Contact your Adobe Account rep for more information. <!--is this phrased correctly? Is this important? -->

## Get started for administrators, analysts, end users, and developers

There are 3 types of Adobe Analytics users in a typical organization: administrators, analysts, and end users. 

Administrators implement and configure Adobe Analytics; analysts set up projects and create analyses using Analysis Workspace, and end users gain actionable insights about their customers, either by creating their own analyses or working with analysts to create them.

Expand the sections below to learn how each of these users can get started with Adobe Analytics.

### Get started for administrators

Analytics administrators are responsible for choosing the implementation method most appropriate for their organization.

After Adobe Analytics is implemented, administrators need to perform various configuration tasks to ensure that analysts and end users are getting the full value from Adobe Analytics. Administrators should also regularly monitor their Analytics environment to ensure the system is running efficiently.

#### Determine the types of data that should be gathered

Adobe Analytics lets you gather data from multiple channels types and bring it together to deliver meaningful, real-time customer insights. 

Following are some of the supported channels where data can be gathered:

* Mobile phones

* The Internet of Things

* TV

* Voice assistants

* Connected cars

* And more (new supported channels are added regularly)

The [implementation method](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/home.html) you choose determines the type of data that can be gathered.

#### Implement Adobe Analytics

Various implementation methods are available when implementing Adobe Analytics on your website or mobile app. 

For information about each available method, see [Implement Adobe Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/home.html).

| | Implementation methods |
|---------|---------|

### Get started for end users

End users who are not professional analysts can either work with analysts in their organization to leverage the full power of Adobe Analytics and Analysis Workspace, or they can learn the basics of Analysis Workspace in order to start gaining actionable insights about their customers.

#### Work with analysts

Typically, users in an organization who are interested in learning more about customer behavior across their various sites are not professional analysts. 

Ideally, these users should work with [analysts](#analysts) within an organization to:

1. Define requirements for the analyses by explaining to the analyst what they hope to learn about customers.

1. Review the analyses to ensure they meet the objectives.

1. Discuss the data gained from the analyses.

1. Modify the analyses as needed over time.

#### Create analyses in Analysis Workspace

You don't have to be a data analyst to gain actionable insights from Adobe Analytics.

Some users might find it helpful to work with a data analyst to set up a project in Analysis Workspace and explain how to interpret the data, as described in [Work with analysts](#work-with-analysts); other users might be comfortable building the project and interpreting the data themselves. 

Analysis Workspace allows you to quickly build analyses to gather insights and then share those insights with others. Using the drag-and-drop browser interface, you can craft your analysis, add visualizations to bring data to life, curate a dataset, and share and schedule projects with anyone you choose.

For information about how to create analyses in Analysis Workspace, see [Analysis Workspace overview](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.md).

### Get started for developers

[Analytics APIs](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/2.0/) allow you to directly call Adobe's servers to perform almost any action that you can perform in the user interface. 

You can create reports to explore, get insights, or answer important questions about your data. You can also manage components of Adobe Analytics, such as the creation of segments or calculated metrics. 

## Video overview

To learn about Adobe Analytics basics, check out this *Intro to Adobe Analytics - Skill Builder Webinar* video. The video walks you through the basics of how data is captured, how data is sent to Adobe Analytics, and what visualization capabilities you can use within Adobe Analytics. The video provides a foundation for you to build, deploy, collect, and interpret data, allowing you to provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the collected data.

## Go further with Customer Journey Analytics

Customer Journey Analytics is Adobe's next-generation Analytics solution that lets you use the power of Analysis Workspace with data from Adobe Experience Platform. It can break down, filter, query, and visualize years' worth of data, and is combined with Platform's ability to hold all kinds of data schemas and types. 

Following are some of the advantages of Customer Journey Analytics over Adobe Analytics:

* **Unlimited variables and events**: The concepts of eVars, props, and events no longer exist. Data is primarily focused on dimensions and metrics. Datasets can have an unlimited number of unique dimensions and metrics.

* **Unlimited unique values**: Adobe Experience Platform is not constrained to any unique limitations.

* **Alter historical data**: Using Adobe Experience Platform, data can be removed or corrected.

* **Cross-report-suite data**: Existing implementations from multiple datasets can be combined in Platform.
