This variable is populated after the page code and before *`doPlugins`* is run.

You may read these values and copy them into props/eVars, but you should never alter them. This variable is introduced with version H.11 of the JavaScript file.

Version H.10 and higher of the JavaScript file accurately detect up to version 1.7 (the highest version at the time H.10 was released). Prior versions of the JavaScript file only detected up to version 1.3
