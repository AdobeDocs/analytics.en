# Add dependent requests

A dependent request is a request that is dependent upon an existing request.

For reports with correlation breakdowns enabled within the report table, you can take a closer look at an item by right-clicking in the cell and clicking **[!UICONTROL Add Dependent Request]** > **[!UICONTROL Breakdown]**.

> [!NOTE] You can also add breakdown request while creating the original request. See [Create a Data Request](/help/analyze/report-builder/data-requests/t-create-a-data-request.md).

> [!NOTE] Adobe Report Builder enforces request dependencies only within the same worksheet, not across worksheets. Restricting to dependencies within a single worksheet ensures timeliness of execution.

See [Breakdown Reports](/help/analyze/reports-analytics/reports-customize/breakdowns.md).
