# Sharing Segments



|  Administrator  | Can share segments with All, with Groups, and with Users. Groups are set up as permission groups in the Admin console.  |
|---|---|
|  Non-Administrator  | Can share segments only with individual users.  |

When should you share segments with the entire company versus just a group of users or individuals? Here are some best practices you might follow: 

* As an Admin, share a segment with ** [!UICONTROL  All] ** if it's of use to the entire company and everyone is comfortable using it. In this case, you should also consider making it an [ approved](seg_approve.md#concept_DF477F151A9E483A92ED1DDAAF035953) segment.
* As an Admin, share a segment with a specific ** [!UICONTROL  Group] ** if the segment provides good business value for that team. Do not officially approve this type of segment.
* As an Admin or an individual user, share a segment with other individuals to vet and validate a segment. If it doesn't prove useful, it can be discarded. Do not officially approve this type of segment.

>1. In the Segment Manager, mark the checkbox next to the segment you want to share. The segment management tool bar appears:
