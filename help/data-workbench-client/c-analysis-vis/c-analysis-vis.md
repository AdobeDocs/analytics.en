# Analysis visualizations

Information about the numerous analysis visualizations available in Data Workbench.

* You can open any visualization by right-clicking within a workspace and selecting the desired menu option, or by clicking **Ctrl** + **n**. 

* Visualizations cannot be imported like workspaces. When you right-click in the worktop and select **[!UICONTROL Import]**, you can import an existing workspace, but not a visualization residing outside of the workspace.

  If you attempt to import a visualization, you will receive a "not a valid workspace" error.
