# Filter Path Reports by Adding Dependent Requests

Describes how to create path reports with predefined filters.

Marketing Reports & Analytics offers a few standalone reports that are top path reports with predefined filters, such as [!UICONTROL Next] and [!UICONTROL Previous Site Section] reports, Entry and [!UICONTROL Exit Site Section] reports, and [!UICONTROL Single Site Section] report.

Report Builder does not offer these as standalone reports, but you can create them through the **[!UICONTROL Add dependent request]** > **[!UICONTROL Path]** context menus. The following reports are available:

* Path > Page Fallout 
* Path > Entry Path 
* Path > Exit Path 
* Path > Next Page 
* Path > Entry Path > next Page 
* Path > Previous Page 
* Path > Exit Path > Previous Page 
* Path > Entry Path > As Entry Page 
* Path > Exit Path > As Exit Page

1. Select multiple rows from an existing request, then right-click **[!UICONTROL Add Dependent Request]** > **[!UICONTROL Path]**. You must select at least three rows if you want to see the **[!UICONTROL Page Fallout]** menu item.

2. Select the predefined filter, for example **[!UICONTROL Previous Page]**.

   The Request Wizard appears, with the Previous Page metric already selected. 1. Continue to refine your request in the Request Wizard and generate your request.
