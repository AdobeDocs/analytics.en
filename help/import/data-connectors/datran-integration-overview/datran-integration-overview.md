# Datran Data Connector for Adobe Analytics {#datran-data-connector-for-adobe-analytics}

This Adobe® Data Connectors email integration combines behavioral information from Adobe Analytics® with Datran email marketing to create a powerful tool to redefine success measurement and target audiences with more relevant messaging.

Delivering relevant email messages to these market segments can result in entirely new revenue opportunities, driving increased conversion and revenue among new and existing email campaigns. For example, delivering relevant email messages based on products that were viewed during a visit or products that were left in an abandoned shopping cart has been proven to have dramatic impact on revenue, with minimal impact on cost because this is simply leveraging visitors your site is already getting. This increase in marketing efficiency is one of the key benefits of integrating Adobe Analytics with Datran. Additionally, this integration will automatically synchronize email metrics with Adobe Analytics data as frequently as hourly for closed-loop reporting.

## What You Should Know Before Activating This Integration{#what-you-should-know-before-activating-this-integration}

Before activating this integration, review the following items against your deployments of Adobe Analytics® and your email software.

Doing so will ensure the appropriate best practices or pre-requisites are in place prior to activation, which will result in an optimal and successful integration.

### Adobe Analytics{#adobe-analytics}

Review the following information about this Data Connectors integration as it relates to Adobe Analytics:

* **Report Suite Specific:** Be advised this integration is report-suite specific. Ensure that you have selected the desired report suite prior to activating the integration. 
* **Authorized Representative:** Be advised that the enablement of this integration might cause your company to incur fees in accordance with your service agreement with Adobe, Inc. or your service agreement with one of Adobe's trusted partners, as applicable. By activating this integration, you hereby represent that you are an authorized representative of your company; and as such, your company agrees to pay the fees, if any, set forth in the service agreement described above. 
* **Omniture Data Warehouse™:** This integration requires Data Warehouse to be enabled in order to generate remarketing segments. If you have not enabled the Data Warehouse, contact Adobe for details. 
* **Recipient ID:** The integration requires that we capture and store a "Visitor ID" within a Adobe Analytics variable (eVar). The Visitor ID (often referred to as the "Recipient ID") is an encoded or numeric representation of an email address from the Datran system. This "Recipient ID" is associated with downstream visitor behavior on the site (cart abandons, purchases, etc.) that is pulled into the Datran system and can be leveraged for remarketing purposes. As part of the setup process, you must identify an eVar for this purpose when prompted by the Wizard. 
* **External Tracking:** If you’re not currently following the best practice of enabling external tracking for each email campaign you send, you must do so to ensure a successful integration. See the Datran section below for details. 
* **Privacy Compliance:** You should understand that by enabling Recipient or Visitor ID tracking, this feature may track personally identifiable information of your site visitors. This has privacy implications requiring the implementation of appropriate procedures by your organization, such as providing notice to, and consent of, your site visitors.
