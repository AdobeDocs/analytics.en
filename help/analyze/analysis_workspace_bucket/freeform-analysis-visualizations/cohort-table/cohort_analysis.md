# What is cohort analysis?

A *` cohort`* is a group of people sharing common characteristics over a specified period. Cohort analysis is useful, for example, when you want to learn how a cohort engages with a brand. You can easily spot changes in trends, then respond accordingly. (Explanations of cohort analysis are available on the web, such as at [ Cohort Analysis 101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_analysis).) 

After creating a cohort report, you can curate its components (specific dimensions, metrics, and segments), then share the cohort report with anyone. See [ Curate and Share](../../../analysis_workspace_bucket/curate/curate.md#concept_4A9726927E7C44AFA260E2BB2721AFC6) 

**Example cohort report** 

A cohort report returns visitors. Each data cell shows the raw number of visitors in the cohort who did the action during that time period.

* Shift marketing budget at exactly the right time in the customer lifecycle.
* Recognize when to end a trial or an offer, to maximize value.
* Gain ideas for A/B testing in areas such as pricing, upgrade path, and so on.
