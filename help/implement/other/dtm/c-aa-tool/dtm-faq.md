# FAQs about the Adobe Analytics Tool

A FAQ about the automatic configuration of the Adobe Analytics deployment. The automatic configuration method manages the [!DNL AppMeasurement] code for you.

Both implementation methods should be equally effective. </p> </td>

You must move this code to the new <span class="wintitle"> Custom Page Code</span> section at the end of the tool configuration so that the code continues executing.

## Potential Pitfalls {#section_201BF9E0EB7D4BC2B72A617543C2030B}

There is a small chance that the integration could cause data collection issues if you currently use [!DNL Adobe Analytics]. These issues could arise only if you publish your library to production subsequent to the release. (Production code remains intact until publishing occurs.)

To avoid these issues, ensure that:

* Report suite IDs are correctly entered in the tool.
* Report suite IDs in the tool match the IDs in the [!DNL AppMeasurement] code.
* The currency code, character set, tracking server, and SSL tracking server configuration fields are correctly set with supported values.
* Custom code is defined in [!DNL Library Management].
