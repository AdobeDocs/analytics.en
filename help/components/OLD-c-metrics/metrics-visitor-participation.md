# Visitor Participation - Ad Hoc Analysis

Visitor Participation is a metric series that lets you view participation across visitor sessions in marketing channels, campaigns, revenue, and so on. For example, purchase and revenue credit can be attributed back to other marketing touch-points that occurred before the visit in which the order took place. Ad hoc analysis provides visitor participation across visits.

 **Revenue (Participation)**: Spreads conversion credit across all of the pages in a single visit that led to the conversion, up to the conversion page.

**Revenue (Visitor Participation)**: Spreads conversion credit across all the pages and across visits, based on a time frame you specify.

**Example - Cross-Visit Revenue Participation**

A visitor has two visits to your site. The conversion event occurs during the second visit, on Page D, for $60 of revenue:

In reporting, the conversion allocation is as follows:

* **Revenue**: Allocated to the page.
* **Revenue (Participation)**: Allocated to the second visit.
* **Revenue (Visitor Participation)**: Allocated across both visits.
