_This article documents the Key metric summary visualization in_ ![AdobeAnalytics](/help/assets/icons/AdobeAnalytics.svg) _**Adobe Analytics**._<br/>_See [Key metric summary](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-workspace/visualizations/key-metric)  for the_ ![CustomerJourneyAnalytics](/help/assets/icons/CustomerJourneyAnalytics.svg) _**Customer Journey Analytics** version of this article._

The ![KeyMetrics](/help/assets/icons/KeyMetrics.svg) **[!UICONTROL Key metric summary]** visualization lets you see how an important metric is trending within a single timeframe. It also lets you compare metric performance across two timeframes. It provides the benefits of multiple visualizations combined into one visualization:

* **[!UICONTROL Line]** visualization shows how the metric is trending for the primary and comparison date ranges

* **[!UICONTROL Summary percent change]** shows the metric increase or decrease between the primary and comparison date ranges

* Current total value ([!UICONTROL **summary number**]) for the metric

## Use cases

This visualization addresses various common use cases, including:

* An analyst trying to understand how opportunity creation looked this month compared to the same timeframe last year. 

* A marketer exploring how lead generation for a specific lead type has changed from this month to last month.

* An executive wanting to understand how new bookings changed from this quarter to last quarter.

## Use

1. Add a ![KeyMetrics](/help/assets/icons/KeyMetrics.svg) **[!UICONTROL Key metric summary]** visualization. See [Add a visualization to a panel](freeform-analysis-visualizations.md#add-visualizations-to-a-panel).

1. Configure the visualization by selecting a **[!UICONTROL Metric]**, a **[!UICONTROL Primary date range]**, a **[!UICONTROL Comparison date range]** (optional) and a **[!UICONTROL Filter]** (optional):

   ![Key metric configuration showing the options for metric, primary date range, comparison date range, and segment.](assets/key-metrics-config.png)

   | Option| Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | **[!UICONTROL Metric]** | Select the metric you want to examine. All metrics are supported. |
   | **[!UICONTROL Primary date range]** | The current date range for the freeform table.<p>Choose from any available date ranges in your data view.</p> <p>Choose [!UICONTROL **Panel date range**] if you want to use the same date range that is being used on the panel where the visualization is located.</p>  |
   | **[!UICONTROL Comparison date range]** | The date range that you want to compare with the primary date range. |
   | **[!UICONTROL Filter (optional)]** | Any filter that you are interested in for this summary.  |

   {style="table-layout:auto"}

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >When the [!UICONTROL **Primary date range**] field is set to [!UICONTROL **Panel date range**], the **[!UICONTROL Comparison date range]** can automatically update, depending on whether the **[!UICONTROL Comparison date range]** option you choose is relative to the primary date range or fixed.
   >
   >* **Relative:** If the **[!UICONTROL Comparison date range]** field is set to an option that is relative to the primary date range (such [!UICONTROL **Previous day**], [!UICONTROL **Same day last week**], [!UICONTROL **Same day 4 weeks prior**], and so forth), then any updates to the [!UICONTROL **Primary date range**] field cause the **[!UICONTROL Comparison date range]** to automatically update to the period that immediately follows the date range of the panel.
   >* **Fixed:** If the [!UICONTROL **Comparison date range**] field is set to a fixed date range (such as **February 3, 2023**), then changes made to the [!UICONTROL **Primary date range**] field or the panel date range have no effect on the [!UICONTROL **Comparison date range**]. However, any updates to the panel date range cause the [!UICONTROL **Primary date range**] to automatically update.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Build]**.

The output of the key metric summary looks like:

![Key metric output showing the metic, summary change, summary number, and line graphs.](assets/key-metrics.png)

Consider the following when viewing the output:

* The **[!UICONTROL Previous period]** line graph (always displayed in gray) corresponds to the **[!UICONTROL Comparison date range]** in the configuration step.

* If a comparison date range is not specified during configuration or is hidden in the visualization settings, only the line graph for the primary date range is displayed. The summary change is hidden. 

* From here, you can hover over the line graphs to see the statistics for individual days:
