# Month of year

The 'Month of year' dimension reports the month of any given year as a dimension value. This report is valuable if you want a report broken out by the month of the year, but do not want a static date as dimension values. You can aggregate year-over-year reports by month, so January data of this year aggregates with January data from last year in the same dimension value.

## Populate this dimension with data

This dimension works out of the box for all implementations. If a report suite contains data, this dimension works.

## Dimension values

Dimension values include months of the year (`January` to `December`), representing the month of the year that the hit occurred on.
