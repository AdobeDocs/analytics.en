# Segment IQ Overview

Analysts can spend many hours or even days searching for relevant differences between segments across your organization's metrics and dimensions. Not only is this analysis tedious and time consuming, you can never be sure if a segment's key difference was missed that could make a big impact to your targeted marketing efforts.

Many organizations have found success using features powered by Segment IQ. See [Segment comparison use cases](c-panels/c-segment-comparison/segment-compare-use-cases.md) for real-world scenarios that provide organizations valuable insight.

## Features

Segment IQ comprises the following features:

* [Segment comparison panel:](c-panels/c-segment-comparison/segment-comparison.md) The core feature in Segment IQ. Drag two segments into the panel, and view a comprehensive report that shows statistically significant differences and overlap between the two audiences.
* [Comparing segments in fallout:](visualizations/fallout/compare-segments-fallout.md) See how different audiences compare to each other in context of a fallout visualization.
