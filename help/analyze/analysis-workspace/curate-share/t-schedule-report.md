## Scheduled Projects manager

Scheduled Analysis Workspace projects can be managed under **Analytics > Components > Scheduled Projects**.

In the Scheduled Projects Manager, you can edit and delete recurring project schedules. Search for a schedule in the search bar or by using the filter options in the left rail. You can filter by tag, approved schedules, owners and more.

The following are common actions in the Scheduled Projects manager:

|Action|Description|
|---|---|
|**Edit schedule**|Click the title of the schedule to update its delivery settings.|
|**Delete schedule**|Select the scheduled project in the list and then click Delete from the menu. This will delete the selected schedule for the project; the project itself will not be deleted.|
|**Add tags**|Select the scheduled project in the list and then choose "Tag" or "Approve" to organize your schedules and make them easier to search for.|

|**View schedule ID**|Navigate to column options in the top right and add the Schedule ID column to the table. The scheduled ID is often useful for debugging.|

The Scheduled Projects Manager shows the items that a specific user has created. If the user account is disabled in the application, all scheduled deliveries stop. Scheduled project ownership can be **transferred** to a new user under **Admin > Analytics Users & Assets > Transfer Assets**.
