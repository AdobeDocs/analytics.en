## Important notices for [!DNL Analytics] administrators

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
|Expiration of allowlist EOL extension for legacy Analytics OAuth/JWT integrations | January 14, 2022 | On **May 25, 2022**, the [Analytics 1.3 API, 1.4 SOAP API, and Legacy Analytics OAuth/JWT EOL](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/APIEOL.md) allowlist extension will expire. It was offered to provide customers using legacy [!DNL Adobe Analytics] OAuth/JWT credentials additional time to migrate their client integrations to [Adobe IMS credentials](https://developer.adobe.com/console). This expiration affects (but is not limited to) [!DNL Adobe Analytics Livestream] and [!DNL Adobe Campaign] customers who have not completed their required IMS migrations. Customers who are currently using legacy [!DNL Analytics] OAuth/JWT credentials via the allowlist extension and who do not complete their migration to IMS credentials by May 25, 2022 will lose access to Adobe services. Livestream customers can refer to these [instructions](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/live-stream-api/getting_started.md) on migrating their client applications to IMS credentials. [!DNL Campaign] customers can reach out to their Adobe account team about upgrading to the latest version of [!DNL Campaign]. |
| EOL for [!DNL Reports & Analytics] | January 4, 2022 | Effective **December 31, 2023**, Adobe intends to discontinue [!DNL Reports & Analytics] and its accompanying reports and features. The reports, visualizations, and underlying technology that power [!DNL Reports & Analytics] no longer meet Adobeâ€™s technology standards. Most [!DNL Reports & Analytics] features are available in [Analysis Workspace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.html). Since the release of Analysis Workspace in 2015, [!DNL Reports & Analytics] functionality and capabilities have been moved to Analysis Workspace and a threshold of workflow parity has been reached. [This notice](https://spark.adobe.com/page/6WnF8JK6IRDhf/) explains the end-of-life process. | 
| Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) services upgrade | January 13, 2022 | On **May 2, 2022**, [!DNL Adobe Analytics] will upgrade its Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) services in order to provide improved security for file transfers. With this change, some SFTP client configurations will no longer be supported. We will also add some connection options which will available by **March 1, 2022**. This will only impact data sent to or retrieved from Adobe Analytics using SFTP. The FTP protocol will not be impacted. In order to avoid service disruptions, please ensure that your SFTP clients (code, tools, services) will be in accordance with the changes detailed [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/export/ftp-and-sftp/secure-file-transfer-protocol/sftp-upgrade.html). |
