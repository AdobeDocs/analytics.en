Visit [Adobe I/O](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experiencecloud/analytics.html), which provides documentation, sample code, and forums related to the Web Services APIs. Click Web Services APIs Overview for more information.

## Filtering Options

When using SOAP, if your XML parser has trouble with illegal or invalid characters in responses to Web Services API calls, select one or both of the following options to have Analytics automatically filter the response output. Typically, this is an issue only with double-byte languages (Japanese, Chinese, Korean).
