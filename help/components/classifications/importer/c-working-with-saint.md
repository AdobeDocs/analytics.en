# Classifications importer - overview

Use the importer to upload classifications into Adobe Analytics. You can also export the data for updating prior to an import.

**[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Classification Importer]**

The data that you import using the import tool must be in a specific format. Adobe provides you with the option to download a data template with all the proper header details in a tab-delimited data file. You can add your new data to this template and then import the data file in the browser, using FTP.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe recommends that you limit the number of import and export columns to 30.

See [Numeric 2 Classifications](/help/components/classifications/c-numeric-2/c-numeric-2-classifications.md) for information about uploading data using numeric 2 classifications.

See [Common Saint Upload Issues](https://helpx.adobe.com/analytics/kb/common-saint-upload-issues.html): Knowledge Base article that describes issues arising from incorrect file formats and file contents.
