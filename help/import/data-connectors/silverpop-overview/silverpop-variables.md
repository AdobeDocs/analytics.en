# Analytics Integration Variables{#analytics-integration-variables}

The Data Connectors integration for Silverpop uses Analytics variables to track various Silverpop metrics.

After identifying the Event and eVars to use with the Silverpop integration, use the Adobe Analytics Admin Console to enable them (see [Report Suites](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/admin/manage-report-suites/report-suites-admin.html)).

The following table describes the Analytics variables needed for the Silverpop integration.
