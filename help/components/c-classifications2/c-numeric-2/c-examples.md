Examples to provide guidance for importing numeric 2 classifications.

<!-- 

c_example_1__rate.xml

In this case, you created the classification on the [!UICONTROL Classification Conversion] manager and want to import the January values: 

|  Key  | MyText  | `~MyCost`  | `~MyCost^~id~`  | `~MyCost^~value~`  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  Product1  | Text1  | `Cost1_jan_var`  |  | `.2`  |
|  Product2  | Text2  | `Cost2_jan_var`  |  | `.3`  |

|   `~MyCost^~period~`  | `~MyCost^~rate~`  | `~MyCost^~hinge~`  |
|---|---|---|
|  2010/01/01 - 2010/01/31  | revenue  | revenue  |
|  2010/01/01 - 2010/01/31  | revenue  | revenue  |

In January, Product1 had a cost of 20% of its revenue (shown in `~MyCost^~value~`) and Product2 had a cost of 30% of its revenue. Because you are importing a new row, `~MyCost^~id~` is blank.

An example of output from the report is shown here:

Period: Jan 2010

Report: Products 

|  Products  | Revenue  | MyCost  |
|---|---|---|
|  Product1  | $10,000.23  | $2000.05  |
|  Product2  | $9,000.04  | $2700.01  |

<!--

|  Product2  | Text2  | `Cost2_jan_var`  | 2  | .3  |
|  Product1  | Text1  | `Cost1_feb_var`  |  | .15  |
|  Product2  | Text2  | `Cost2_feb_var`  |  | .25  |

|  `~MyCost^~period~`  | `~MyCost^~rate~`  | `~MyCost^~hinge~`  |
|---|---|---|
|  2010/01/01 - 2010/01/31  | revenue  | revenue  |
|  2010/01/01 - 2010/01/31  | revenue  | revenue  |
|  2010/02/01 - 2010/02/28  | revenue  | revenue  |
|  2010/02/01 - 2010/02/28  | revenue  | revenue  |

In February, the user's cost for Product1 went down to 15% of the revenue, and Product2 went down to 25% of its revenue.

You would therefore import the following data: 

|  Key  | MyText  | `~MyCost`  | `~MyCost^~id~`  | `~MyCost^~value~`  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  Product1  | Text1  | `Cost1_mar_fixed`  |  | 3000.00  |
|  Product2  | Text2  | `Cost2_jan_fixed`  |  | 2000.00  |

|  `~MyCost^~period~`  | `~MyCost^~rate~`  | `~MyCost^~hinge~`  |
|---|---|---|
|  2010/03/01 - 2010/03/31  | fixed  | none  |
|  2010/03/01 - 2010/03/31  | fixed  | none  |

|  Product1  | $11,023.75  | $3000.00  |
|  Product2  | $8,000.12  | $2000.00  |

<!--

In this example, you add a $500 shipping charge to Product1 for January, and a $600 shipping charge to February.

|  Key  | MyText  | `~MyCost`  | `~MyCost^~id~`  | `~MyCost^~value~`  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  Product1  | Text1  | `Cost1_jan_var`  | 1  | .2  |
|  Product1  | Text1  | `Cost2_jan_fixed`  |  | 500  |
|  Product1  | Text1  | `Cost1_feb_var`  | 2  | .15  |
|  Product1  | Text1  | `Cost2_feb_fixed`  |  | 600  |

|  `~MyCost^~period~`  | `~MyCost^~rate~`  | `~MyCost^~hinge~`  |
|---|---|---|
|  2010/01/01 - 2010/01/31  | revenue  | revenue  |
|  2010/01/01 - 2010/01/31  | fixed  | none  |
|  2010/02/01 - 2010/01/31  | revenue  | revenue  |
|  2010/02/01 - 2010/01/31  | fixed  | none  |

The rows that were previously imported have an ID, which indicates that they are not new costs.
