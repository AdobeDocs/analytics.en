# Bounce Rate

Shows the percentage of visits that contain a single hit.

Bounce rate uses the [Bounces](../../../components/c-variables/c-metrics/metrics-bounces.md#concept_2A92D575504E4522B860AB44B0621593) metric and is calculated as:

`Bounces divided by Entries`

Bounce Rate does not include visits where multiple actions occurred on a single page. For example, a visit with a video view on a single page is a Single Access but not a Bounce.

>Existing implementations can sometimes contain a calculated metric that differs from the Analytics default metric. Check the calculated metric definition to make sure there are no differences.
