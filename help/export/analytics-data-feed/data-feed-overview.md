# Analytics Data Feed overview

Data feeds are a powerful way to get raw data out of Adobe Analytics. This raw data can be used in other platforms outside of Adobe to use at your organization's discretion. Data is delivered in hourly batches at the conclusion of each hour, or in daily batches at the conclusion of each day.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you meet all the following requirements before using data feeds.

* Have an FTP site and credentials handy. Data feeds can only be sent to a server destination. Your organization typically provides FTP credentials. Adobe can provide an FTP location with a modest amount of storage at your request. Contact Customer Care to request an FTP destination for data feeds.
* A working implementation that sends data to Adobe data collection servers. See [Validate and publish an implementation in Launch](/help/implement/launch/validate-publish-prod.md) in the Implement user guide.
* Your account is an Analytics product admin, or your account belongs to a product profile with access to data feeds.

## Steps to get started

1. Log in to [experiencecloud.adobe.com](https://experiencecloud.adobe.com) using your Adobe ID credentials.
2. Click the 9-square icon in the upper right, then click the colored Analytics logo.
3. In the top navigation bar, navigate to Admin > Data feeds.
4. Click [!UICONTROL Add]. A new page appears with three main categories: [!UICONTROL Feed information], [!UICONTROL Destination], and [!UICONTROL Data Column Definitions].
5. Fill out [!UICONTROL Feed Information] fields.
   * Name: Any desired name, such as "Test data feed".
   * Report suite: Select the desired report suite.
   * Email when complete: Enter your email.
   * Feed interval: Select the desired interval (hourly or daily).
   * Delay processing: Can be left as [!UICONTROL No Delay].
   * Start & end dates: Select a start date from several days ago, and today as the end date.
6. Fill out [!UICONTROL Destination] fields.
   * Type: FTP
   * Host: Enter the desired FTP destination URL. For example, `ftp://ftp.omniture.com`.
   * Path: Can be left blank
   * Username: Enter the username to log in to the FTP site.
   * Password and confirm password: Enter the password to log in to the FTP site.
7. Fill out [!UICONTROL Data Column Definitions].
   * Select the latest 'All Adobe Columns' template in the dropdown.
   * Compression format: Gzip
   * Packaging type: Multiple files
   * Manifest: No File
8. Click [!UICONTROL Save] in the top right.
9. Once saved, historical data processing begins. When data finishes processing for a day, the file is placed on the FTP site.
10. Log in to the FTP site using Windows Explorer or a dedicated FTP client.
11. Download the compressed data feed file to your local machine.
12. Unzip the compressed file using a program that supports `.tar.gz` file extensions.
13. Open the `hit_data.tsv` file in your spreadsheet or database application of choice to see raw data for that day.

## Next steps
