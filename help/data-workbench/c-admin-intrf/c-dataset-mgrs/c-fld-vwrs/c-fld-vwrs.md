# Field viewer

A field viewer is a table containing the values of one or more data fields.

The fields whose values display are inputs or outputs of a dataset’s log sources, transformations, or extended dimensions. The field’s name is shown in the column heading, and each row contains the field’s value for a single row of source data. Because field viewers enable you to see a field’s values, they are helpful in writing and testing regular expressions.

For information about regular expressions, see the *Dataset Configuration Guide*.
