# Reporting Activity Manager

{{release-limited-testing}}

The [!UICONTROL Reporting Activity Manager] lets you see the reporting capacity for each report suite in your organization. It provides you, as an Admin, with detailed visibility into reporting consumption and helps you easily diagnose and fix capacity issues during peak reporting times. 

When your organization reaches reporting request capacity and experiences a degradation in reporting performance, you now have a way to self-diagnose reporting issues without intervention from Adobe customer care or engineering. You can easily manage reporting queues within a single interface and immediately act​​ to improve your users' experience. This tool:

* Informs you, in real time, about your current reporting capacity across your report suites.
* Provides detailed report query information on current reporting requests, whether queued or in progress.
* Lets you optimize the reporting queue by prioritizing some and canceling other reporting requests to free up capacity. In other words, you can ask in real time: is this report necessary at this time or can I cancel it in favor of more urgent reports?

## Access the Reporting Activity Manager

In Adobe Analytics, Admins go to **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Reporting Activity Manager]**.

## Permissions

You require the Analytics Product Administrator permission (in Adobe Admin Console) to manage reporting activity.

![permission](/help/admin/admin/assets/rep-mgr-permission.png)

## View the reports queue

When opening the [!UICONTROL Reporting Activity] Manager overview page, you see a list of your enabled base report suites.

![reports queue](/help/admin/admin/assets/reporting-activity1.png)

| UI Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **[!UICONTROL Report Suite]** | The base report suite whose reporting activity you are monitoring.|
|  **[!UICONTROL Virtual Report Suite]** | Shows all virtual report suites that feed into this base report suite. Virtual report suites add complexity to reporting requests due to additional levels of applied filtering and segmentation. All requests that are coming from the virtual report suites are combined and come down to the base report suite.<p>For example, f you have 10 requests coming from 5 VRSs, that's 50 requests at the base level report suite. This way, you can very quickly hit capacity. |
| **[!UICONTROL Usage Capacity]** | Percentage wise, how much of the report suite's reporting capacity is being used, in real time. |
| **[!UICONTROL Status]** | Four possible status indicators: <ul><li>**Red - [!UICONTROL At Capacity]**: The report suite is maxed out in terms of reporting capacity. (100%) </li><li>**Yellow - [!UICONTROL Nearing capacity]**: This report suite is in danger of reaching its maximum capacity. (90% - 99%)</li><li>**Green - [!UICONTROL All good]**: There is plenty of reporting capacity. (0% - 89%)</li><li>**Grey - [!UICONTROL Status pending/Not enabled]**: Report capacity not available.</li></ul>|

### Line graph {#line}

The line graph shows the reporting activity for the selected report suite over the last 2 hours. 

* The x-axis shows the reporting capacity data over the last 2 hours.
* The y-axis shows the reporting usage capacity % for the selected report suite, by minute.
* You can hover over the line chart to view points in time where the usage capacity % represented will be the highest % for that minute.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Cancel x query]** window that appears, you can modify the cancellation message, if needed.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Continue]**.

   ![cancel-query](/help/admin/admin/assets/cancel-query.png)
