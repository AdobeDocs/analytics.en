# Overview of Adobe Analytics dashboards

Adobe Analytics dashboards provide anytime, anywhere insights from Adobe Analytics. The app allows users mobile access to intuitive scorecards that you create and share from Adobe Analyticsâ€™ desktop UI. Scorecards are a collection of key metrics and other components presented in a tiled layout that you can tap for more detailed breakdowns and trended reports. You can tailor Scorecards according to the data most important to you. Analytics dashboards are supported on both iOS and Android operating systems.

## Curator tasks

Curators may be organizational administrators or persons in other roles who are responsible for setting up app scorecards. Scorecards allow executive users to view a broad rendering of important summary data quickly and easily on their own mobile devices. Executive users are the end-users for Analytics dashboards. As a curator, you should complete these tasks to effectively set up the app for executives:

1. [Create scorecards for executives](/help/analyze/mobile-app/create-scorecard.md).
1. [Assist executives with app setup and using the app](/help/analyze/mobile-app/set-up-execs.md).
