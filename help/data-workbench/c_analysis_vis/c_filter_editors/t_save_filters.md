1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Filter]**.

       After you save the filter, you can load it to use in other workspaces. See below how to load an existing filter or reference it by name in a [!UICONTROL Metric Editor]. See [Creating and Editing Derived Metrics](../../c_admin_intrf/c_prof_mgr/c_drvd_mtrcs.md#concept_E41723B342A849309874B26232224A40).

       >[!NOTE]
       >
       >If you would like all users of a profile to use the filters that you save, you must upload them to the appropriate profile using the [!UICONTROL Profile Manager]. See [Publishing Files to Your Working Profile](../../c_admin_intrf/c_prof_mgr/t_pub_files_wkg_prof.md#task_A0106E010C834D16BD60EEF4721B6AF9).

       **To load an existing filter**
