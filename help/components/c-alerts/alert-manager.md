# Alert Manager

The Alert Manager is structured very much like the [Segment Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-manage.html) and the [Calculated Metric Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/calculated-metrics/calcmetric-workflow/cm-manager.html).

* Delete alerts.
* Rename alerts.
* Approve alerts.
* Copy alerts.
* Enable/disable alerts.
* **Renew** an alert expiration date. When one or more alerts are selected, they can be renewed by clicking **[!UICONTROL Renew]**.This extends their expiration dates to be 1 year from the day **[!UICONTROL Renew]** was clicked, regardless of their original expiration date.
* Export an alert to a .CSV file.
* Edit alerts by double-clicking the alert title.
* Search for alerts.
* Add alerts to other report suites.
* Specify/change the owner of an alert.

You can configure the information displayed for each alert in the Alerts manager by configuring the columns that are displayed.

To configure the visible columns in the Alerts manager:

1. In the Alert manager, select the **Customize columns** icon ![Customize columns icon](assets/customize-columns-icon.png), then select the columns that you want to be displayed in the Alerts manager.

   The following columns are available:

   | Column title  | Description |
   |---|---|
   | Favorites  | Displays star icons next to each alert, allowing you to mark alerts as favorites. <!-- For more information, see [Mark calculated metrics as favorites](/help/components/c-calcmetrics/c-workflow/cm-workflow/cm-favorite.md). --> |
