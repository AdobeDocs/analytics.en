# Implement Adobe Analytics with Adobe Experience Platform Edge

Adobe Experience Platform Edge allows you to send data destined to multiple products to a centralized location. Experience Edge forwards the appropriate information to the desired products. This concept allows you to consolidate implementation efforts, especially spanning multiple data solutions.

Adobe offers three main ways to send data to Experience Edge:

* **[Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK](web-sdk/overview.md)**: Use the Web SDK extension in Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection to send data to Edge.
* **[Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK](mobile-sdk/overview.md)**: Use the Mobile SDK extension in Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection to send data to Edge.
* **[Edge Network Server API](edge-api/overview.md)**: Send data directly to Edge using an API.
