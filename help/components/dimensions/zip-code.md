# Zip code

The 'Zip code' dimension reports the zip or postal code of the visitor. You can use this dimension to understand more about the success of local advertising or see where in the world your site performs best.

## Populate this dimension with data

This dimension is unique in that it contains multiple ways to populate it with data. You can use either one, or a combination of both.

* Set the zip code directly using the `zip` variable; or
* Configure it to pull from geosegmentation data.

The [!UICONTROL Zip option] under [General account settings](/help/admin/admin/general-acct-settings-admin.md) controls how you want to populate this dimension.

>[!IMPORTANT] The report suite setting is vital if you want full control over how you populate this dimension.

## Dimension values

Dimension values include the zip or postal code of the visitor.
