# Web Services

The Web Services APIs provide programmatic access to marketing reports and other Suite services that let you duplicate and augment functionality available through the Analytics interface.

**[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL All admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Company settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Web Services]** or **[!UICONTROL API Access]**


## Analytics 2.0 APIs

To access the Analytics 2.0 APIs, you need the global company ID of your Analytics Company. You can find the global company ID in **bold** at the top of the [!UICONTROL API Access] section. Here is an example: "The global company ID for the Analytics Company you are currently logged into is **adobe1234**."

## Manage Legacy Web Services (Deprecated)

In the [Adobe Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-console.html) you can update the permissions to include those users that need access to the Web Services APIs.

## Filtering Options

When using SOAP, if your XML parser has trouble with illegal or invalid characters in responses to Web Services API calls, select one or both of the following options to have Analytics automatically filter the response output. Typically, this is an issue only with double-byte languages (Japanese, Chinese, Korean).
