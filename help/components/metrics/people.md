# People

There are two versions of the people metric.
 
For members of the Device Co-op that are not using Cross-Device Analytics, the People metric is a statistically-derived count of the number of people represented in the report, based on the specific visitor IDs in that report which can be identified by the Device Co-op, plus the number of devices which are not identified by the Co-op.
 
Within a Cross-Device Analytics virtual report suite, People is the count distinct of persons in the report. It is a direct count as opposed to a statistical derivation. The definition of a person in CDA is based on either the Device Co-op, Private Graph, or field-based stitching, depending on how CDA is configured for the base report suite used in the CDA virtual report suite. People is the sum of individuals who have been identified in the report, plus the number of devices which have not been identified as belonging to a person.
