# Projects overview
 
Workspace projects allow you to combine panels, visualizations and components to craft your analysis and share with anyone in your organization. Before you start your first project, learn about how to access, navigate and manage your projects.  

To access projects in Adobe Analytics, select **[!UICONTROL Workspace]**.  The **[!UICONTROL Projects]** manager lists all the projects that you own or projects that are shared with you. The Project manager with the Project list is also the default landing page for Adobe Analytics, unless you have configured otherwise in Preferences.

## Project canvas {#canvas}

The project canvas is where you bring together panels, tables, visualizations, and components to build your analysis. A project can contain many panels, and each panel can contain many tables and visualizations.

Panels are helpful when you want to organize your projects according to time periods, report suites, or analysis use case. The active panel has a colored border around it, and determines what components are available in the left rail.

Depending on the starting point you chose for your projects, you either have a [freeform table](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/freeform-table) or a [blank panel](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/panels/blank-panel) in the canvas to begin with. The quickest way to start analyzing is to select one or many components and simply drag & drop them into the project canvas. A table of data is rendered automatically for you. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/freeform-table) about the different options for building a table, or leverage the available [training tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home) for more guidance on building your first project.
