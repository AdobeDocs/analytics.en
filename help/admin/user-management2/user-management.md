# User and Product Management

Manage Analytics users, groups, and products in the Admin Console.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>User and product management is moving to the [Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-console.html). Adobe will notify you when it is your time to migrate users. After all customers have migrated, help content for **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Admin Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL User Management]** will be retired.

   <td colname="col2"> <p> Adobe is assisting Analytics administrators to migrate user IDs to the Adobe Admin Console. This effort will occur in waves. When it is your turn to migrate your users, Adobe will notify Analytics administrators via email with instructions. At that time, a <a href="https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/admin/user-product-management/user-management/migrate-users/c-migration-tool.html"> migration tool</a> will be available in Analytics User Management to simplify this task. </p> <p>Important: On the day of your users' migration, your former permission groups are automatically copied to the Admin Console. You will no longer be able to invite new users or create new groups in Analytics Admin Tools. Review the FAQ and help in <a href="https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/experience-cloud/admin-console/analytics-migration/"> Analytics User Migration to the Admin Console</a> for information about how to prepare for the migration and about administrative features that are affected. </p> </td>
