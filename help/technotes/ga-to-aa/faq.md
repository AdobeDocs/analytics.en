# Frequently asked questions

**How can I migrate my historical data from my third-party platform to Adobe?**

Every Analytics platform has different ways of collecting, handling, and storing data. Rather than migrating historical data, Adobe recommends establishing a clear cut-over date to start collecting and using data within Adobe Analytics. Frequent cut-over dates used are the beginning of a fiscal year, the beginning of a calendar year, or the beginning of a calendar month. If users would like to view historical data, they can log in to the third-party platform to obtain any specific historical reporting needs.

If your organization is adamant about having historical data ported over to Adobe, contact your organization's Account Manager. An implementation consultant can work with your organization to translate a Google Analytics data export into a data source that can be ingested by Adobe data collection servers.

Adobe does not recommend porting historical data, as it is a complex process and is cost-prohibitive to your organization. Visitor identification is also impossible to seamlessly port to Adobe, as visitor information is stored in different cookies and different formats between platforms.
