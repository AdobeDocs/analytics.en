# Browser Height

Refers to the vertical distance of the data in the browser window only. The toolbars, menus, buttons, and so forth, are all excluded as part of the browser height dimension.

 Adobe Analytics uses the browser height and width only from the first hit of a visit. The rest of the hits do not get the attribution for the same visit.

For more information, see [Browser Width/Height](/help/components/c-variables/dimensionslist/browser-width.md).
