# Schedule report requests

You can schedule report requests, specify advanced delivery options, specify recipients, and view the schedule history. Advanced delivery options let you configure reports that you want to send at a specific time or in intervals. You can also specify the file format in which to send the report.

For example, you can schedule reports to be delivered immediately or on a recurring schedule, and specify the file format in [!DNL Advanced Delivery Options]. The file size limit is 5 MB for a report upload.

Additionally, after you create a report schedule in Report Builder, you can view and edit the schedule in **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Reports]**. (See [Report Schedule and Distribution](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/user/index.html#Report%20Schedule%20and%20Distribution) in Reports & Analytics help.)

>[!NOTE]
>
>You must have Excel 2007 or the compatibility pack installed in order to schedule a report.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can have a maximum of 10 scheduled workbooks per Report Builder license. However, you can increase this number by subtracting from other licenses. To do so, go to **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Company Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Report Builder Reports]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>A workbook that has been scheduled (or uploaded to the Workbook Library) and has not been touched (updated, replaced) in more than 28 months will be deleted.
