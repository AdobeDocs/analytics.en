# Reports Menu{#reports-menu}

An overview of the Reports menu in Reports & Analytics.

The Reports Menu provides:

* Access to the complete set of reports 
* Ability to set favorite reports for quick access 
* Frequently viewed reports 
* Enhanced search

![](assets/menu-mainnav.png)

My Favorites, Frequently Viewed, and Report History are all report-suite specific. If you change report suites, all three lists will change.

Reports are navigated using a hierarchical column view. Click **[!UICONTROL View All Reports]**, or press the Forward Slash key (/), and then press the Down Arrow key (?) to quickly display and navigate the menu using the Arrow keys. Press the Escape key to close the menu without changing the current report, or press Enter to load the selected report.
