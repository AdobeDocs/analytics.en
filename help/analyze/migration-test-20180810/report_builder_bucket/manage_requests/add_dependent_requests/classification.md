# Classification

For example, a [!UICONTROL  Campaign] report might have a [!UICONTROL  Manager] classification and an [!UICONTROL  Outlet] classification. These classifications can then be ordered following a certain hierarchy, and each group of report values can be broken down into subgroups. 

You access classifications in the same way you access the other reports of a report suite, and the dimensions are displayed as a top-level report within the group. If a report has classifications, a menu subgroup is created to collect the report and all its classifications in the same location. The report displays as the last entry in the list among the classifications. 

See [ Classifications](http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/index.html?f=classifications) in Analytics Reference Help for information about how Reports and Analytics uses classifications.
