## Introduction

Adobe Analytics dashboards provide anytime, anywhere insights from Adobe Analytics. The app allows users mobile access to intuitive scorecards that you create and share from Adobe Analytics’ desktop UI. Scorecards are a collection of key metrics and other components presented in a tiled layout that you can tap for more detailed breakdowns and trended reports. You can tailor Scorecards according to the data most important to you. Analytics dashboards are supported on both iOS and Android operating systems.

## More about this guide

This guide is intended to help curators of Adobe Analytics data configure Scorecards for their executive users on dashboards. Curators may be organizational administrators or persons in other roles who are responsible for setting up app Scorecards, which allow executive users to view a broad rendering of important summary data quickly and easily on their own mobile devices. Although executive users are the end-users for Analytics dashboards, this guide will help data curators set up the app effectively for those users.
