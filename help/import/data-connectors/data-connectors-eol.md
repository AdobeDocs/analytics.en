# End-of-life for Adobe Data Connectors

For more than a decade, Adobe Analytics has aimed to provide the best-in-class web & marketing analytics solution to meet customers' needs. As technology and business needs evolve, we strive to continually deliver and meet the highest standards.  Unfortunately, the APIs that power this integration no longer meet those standards and are not tenable in modern Adobe Analytics technology infrastructure.

**Effective August 19, 2021**, Adobe has discontinued Data Connectors Integrations. End-of-life is part of any technology product's lifecycle and Adobe aims to make the transition as seamless as possible for our customers and partners. Many of these integrations are available via Adobe Exchange and can continue to be utilized.  

## Why are we end-of-lifing this feature?

This feature is powered by legacy technology that is no longer viable or supported. The [Adobe Exchange Marketplace](https://exchange.adobe.com/experiencecloud.analytics.html#product) is now the place to find current integrations for Adobe solutions.

## How does removal of this feature impact you?

If you are an Adobe Partner, details on migrating your integration to our new Adobe Exchange program can found [here](https://adobeexchangeec.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003867071-Adobe-Analytics-Integration-Tools) in our documentation.  

If you are a Data Connector customer and want to request that the integration you use should be migrated, you should *route all requests directly to the Integration Partner*. The partner needs to commit to moving to the new APIs. Unfortunately, Adobe Customer Care cannot compel partners to move to the new APIs.

Each company providing an integration was given the option to migrate their integration to Adobe Exchange or discontinue their integration. Below is a summary of each current integration and their accompanying decision.

For additional questions or support, please reach out to Adobe Customer Care.

## Exception: Adobe Campaign Classic

The ONE exception to the August 1, 2021 date is the Adobe Campaign Classic integration. This integration will officially be deprecated on March 1, 2022. 

On August 1, 2021, Adobe Campaign Classic will be removed from the Data Connectors UI along with all other integrations; however, existing Campaign integrations will continue to collect and pass data to Adobe Analytics until March 1, 2022. On March 1, 2022, the integration will cease to collect and pass data to Adobe Analytics. If you are using this integration, you need to move to the new Campaign-Analytics connector before March 1, 2022. Learn more in [Adobe Campaign Classic documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/release-notes/aa-connector-migration.html).
