# Dimensions overview

Dimensions are variables in Adobe Analytics that typically contain string values. Common dimensions include [Page](page.md), [Referring domain](referring-domain.md), or an [eVar](evar.md). In contrast, [metrics](../metrics/overview.md) contain numeric values that tie to a dimension. A basic report shows rows of string values (dimension), against a column of numeric values (metric).

For example, if you combined the 'Page' dimension with the 'Visits' metric, you would get a ranked report showing your top-visited pages:

| `Page` | `Visits` |
| --- | --- |
| `Home page` | `800` |
| `Product page` | `500` |
| `Purchase page` | `100` |

Each dimension represents a different part or facet of your site. You can combine one of more of these dimensions with one or more metrics to create a desired report.

## Add dimension descriptions

Analytics administrators can add descriptions for dimensions and other components either within the Report Suite or directly within Analysis Workspace. For information about how to add descriptions to dimensions, see [Add component descriptions](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/add-component-descriptions.md).
