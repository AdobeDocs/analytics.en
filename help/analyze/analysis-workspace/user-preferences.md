| **Templates Tab tab** | | |
|  | Hide Templates Tab | Hides the Templates Tab for all users in your organization. |
| **Project sharing** | | |
| | Allow sharing only with Workspace users | When this option is enabled, users in your organization cannot see the **[!UICONTROL Share with anyone]** option in the **[!UICONTROL Share]** menu. Users cannot share projects with people who do not have an Analysis Workspace account in your organization as described in [Share a project with anyone (no login required)](/help/analysis-workspace/curate-share/share-projects.md#share-public-link).<br/>This option is disabled by default for all organizations, except for customers who have licensed Healthcare Shield. <p>Consider the following when enabling or disabling this option:<ul><li>When you enable this option, people who previously received access to a project through the **[!UICONTROL Share with anyone]** share option can no longer access the project.</li><li>If this option is enabled (to allow sharing only with Workspace users) and then later disabled (to allow sharing with anyone), people who previously received access to a project through the **[!UICONTROL Share with anyone]** share option do not automatically regain their access to the project. In this case, the user who shared the project must enable the [!UICONTROL **Link is active**] option that is available when sharing a project with anyone **([!UICONTROL Share]** > **[!UICONTROL Share with anyone]**), as described in [Share a project with anyone (no login required)](/help/analysis-workspace/curate-share/share-projects.md#share-public-link).</li><li>**For customers who license Healthcare Shield:** This option is enabled by default and cannot be disabled. Before you can disable this option so that users can use the **[!UICONTROL Share with anyone]** share option, you first need to add the [!UICONTROL Share project links with anyone] permission (located under [!UICONTROL Reporting Tools]) in the Adobe Admin Console. After the permission is added, you can disable this option, then accept the resulting legal notice. For information about how to add a permission in the Admin Console, see [Manage product permissions in the Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/manage-permissions-and-roles.html).</li></ul> | 
| | Require Experience Cloud authentication | When this option is enabled, people who are given access to a project from the **[!UICONTROL Share with anyone]** option in Analysis Workspace must authenticate using their Experience Cloud credentials.<p>After this option is enabled, any time a user shares a project using the **[!UICONTROL Share with anyone]** share option, the **[!UICONTROL Require Experience Cloud authentication]** option is enabled in the share dialog and it cannot be disabled by the user who is sharing the project. For information about how users can share projects with anyone, see [Share a project with anyone (no login required)](/help/analysis-workspace/curate-share/share-projects.md#share-public-link). <p> <p>Consider the following when enabling this option: <ul><li>When you enable this option, all projects that were previously shared with the **[!UICONTROL Share with anyone]** share option, and do not have the [!UICONTROL Require Experience Cloud authentication] option enabled, are deactivated.<p>If this option is enabled (to require Experience Cloud authentication) and then later disabled (to allow anyone with the link to access the project), people who previously received access to a project through the **[!UICONTROL Share with anyone]** share option do not automatically regain their access to the project. In this case, the user who shared the project must enable the [!UICONTROL Link is active] option that is available when sharing a project with anyone **([!UICONTROL Share]** > **[!UICONTROL Share with anyone]** > **[!UICONTROL Link is active]**), as described in [Share a project with anyone (no login required)](/help/analysis-workspace/curate-share/share-projects.md#share-public-link).</li><li>This option is available only if SSO is implemented in your organization. For information about how system administrators can enable SSO for your organization, see [Set up identity and Single Sign-On](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/set-up-identity.html).</p><p>If SSO is configured for your organization, check to see if any kind of auto-account creation is implemented in the console. Typically, a system administrator would set this up, as described in [Enable automatic account creation](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/automatic-account-creation.html).</li><li>If your organization licenses Healthcare Shield, this option is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.</li></ul>|

You can customize freeform table preferences for all new projects that you create in Analysis Workspace. For information about how to access these preferences, see [Update preferences](#update-preferences). 

Some of these same preferences can also be customized for individual tables.

Click the linked section titles for more information and context about the available preferences.

| Section | Preference | Options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Table** | | |
| | Table type | <ul><li>Freeform</li><li>Table builder</li></ul> |
| | Default table metric | <ul><li>Occurrences</li><li>Unique Visitors</li><li>Visits</li></ul> |
| | Default table dimension | Choose from Minute, Hour, Day, Week, Month, Quarter, or Year. |
| | Align dates | Select this option to align dates from each column to all start on the same row. |
| **[Column](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/column-row-settings/column-settings.md)** | | |
| | Wrap header text | Wrap the header text in Freeform tables to make headers more readable and tables more shareable. Wrapping is useful for PDF rendering and for metrics with long names. Enabled by default. |
| | Show totals | This total is typically equal to or a subset of the [!UICONTROL Grand total]. It reflects any table filters applied within the freeform table, including the [!UICONTROL Include None] option. |
| | Show grand totals | This total represents all hits that have been collected, sometimes referred to as *report suite total*. When a segment is applied either at the panel level or within the freeform table, this total adjusts to reflect all hits that match the segment criteria. Grand total is not supported for tables or breakdowns with [static rows](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/workspace-totals.md). |
| | Show sparkline  | Show or hide line charts at the bottom of the chart. When hidden, the legend changes to no longer visually reference the lines. |
| | Number | Determines if a cell shows/hides the numeric value for the metric. For example, if the metric is page views, the numeric value is the number of page views for the row item. |
| | Percent | Determines if a cell shows/hides the percent value for the metric. For example, if the metric is page views, the percent value is the number of page views for the row item divided by the total page views for the column.  Note: To be more accurate: percentages greater than 100% are sometines shown. The upper bound cap is moved to 1,000% to ensure that columns can grow in widths too large. |
| | Show anomalies | Determines if anomaly detection is run on the values in this column. |
| | Interpret zero as no value | For cells with a 0 value, determines whether to show a 0 or a blank cell. This is useful when you look at data for each day of a month, and some days haven't happened yet.  Instead of showing 0's for future dates, blank cells can be shown instead. Charts respect this setting as well (that is, they do not show a line or bar with 0 values when this setting is checked). |
| | Background | Determines if a cell shows/hides all cell formatting, including the bar graph and conditional formatting <ul><li>Bar graph</li> A horizontal bar graph representing the cell's value relative to the total for the column. <li>Conditional formatting</li>For more information about conditional formatting, see "Conditional formatting" in [Column Settings](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/column-row-settings/column-settings.md)</ul> |
| | Cell preview | A preview of how each cell appears with the currently selected formatting options applied. |
| **[Row](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/column-row-settings/table-settings.md)** | | |
| | Breakdown by position | Select this option if you want the breakdown to remain with the position of the item rather than with the item itself. For more information about breakdowns, see [Break down dimensions](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/components/dimensions/t-breakdown-fa.md). |
| | Percentage calculation | <ul><li>Column</li><li>Row</li></ul> |
| | Column totals (Static rows only) |<ul><li>Display sum of rows: Shows the sum of the individual line items </li><li>Display grand total: Shows the de-duplicated sum of rows.</li></ul> |

## Visualizations preferences

You can update visualization preferences for all new projects that you create in Analysis Workspace. For information about how to access these preferences, see [Update preferences](#update-preferences). 

Some of these same preferences can also be customized for individual visualizations. 

Click the linked section titles for more information and context about the available preferences. 

| Section | Preference | Options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **General Defaults** | | |
| | Percentages | Displays values in percentages for all visualizations. |
| | Legend visible | Lets you hide the detailed legend text for all visualizations.  |
| | Limit max items | Reduces the number of items on the X-axis for all visualizations. This can be useful if you have a large data set.  |
| | Display dual axis (when applicable) | Applies only if you have two metrics - you can have a y-axis on the left (for one metric) and on the right (for the other metric). This setting is helpful when plotted metrics are of very different magnitudes.  |
| | Normalization (when applicable) | Forces metrics to equal proportions. This setting is helpful when plotted metrics are of very different magnitudes.  |
| | Anchor Y-axis at zero | If all the values plotted on the chart are considerably above zero, the chart default makes the bottom of the y-axis NON-ZERO. If you check this box, the y-axis is forced to zero (and it re-draws the chart).  |
| | Allow anomalies to scale Y-axis | If you have multiple metrics in a chart, you have to hover over each anomaly to see the confidence band for that metric. To make the visualization more legible, the Anomaly Detection confidence interval does not automatically scale the y-axis. This option allows the confidence interval to scale the visualization. <p>For more information, see [View anomalies in Analysis Workspace](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/c-anomaly-detection/view-anomalies.md).</p>  |
| **[Line](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/line.md)** | | |
| | Percentages  | Displays values in percentages for the Line visualizations. |
| | Legend visible | Hide the detailed legend text for the Line visualization. |
| | Limit max items | Reduces the number of items on the X-axis in the Line visualization. This setting is useful if you have a large data set. |
| | Display dual axis (when applicable) | Applies only if you have two metrics - you can have a y-axis on the left (for one metric) and on the right (for the other metric). This setting is helpful when plotted metrics are of very different magnitudes. |
| | Normalization (when applicable) | Forces metrics to equal proportions. This setting is helpful when plotted metrics are of very different magnitudes. |
| | Show x-axis | Displays the x-axis on the Line chart. |
| | Show y-axis | Displays the y-axis on the Line chart.  |
| | Anchor Y-axis | If all the values plotted on the chart are considerably above zero, the chart default makes the bottom of the y-axis NON-ZERO. If you check this box, the y-axis is forced to zero (and it re-draws the chart). |
| | Show min | Overlay a minimum value label to highlight quickly the valleys in a metric. Note: The min values are derived from the visible data points in the visualization, not the full set of values within a dimension. |
| | Show max | overlay a maximum value label to highlight quickly the peaks in a metric. Note: The max values are derived from the visible data points in the visualization, not the full set of values within a dimension. |
| | Show trendline | Show a regression or moving average trendline to your line series. Trendlines help to depict a clearer pattern in the data. |
| **[Cohort](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/cohort-table/t-cohort.md)** | | |
| | Granularity | For trended visualizations, you can change the time granularity (Day, Week, Month, Quarter, or Year). This change also applies to the data source table. |
| | Only show percent | Removes the number value and only shows the percentage. |
| | Round percent to nearest whole | Rounds the percent value to the nearest whole instead of showing the decimal value. |
| | Show average percent row | Inserts a new row at the top of the table and then adds the average for the values within each column.  |
| | Cohort Preview | A preview of how the color palette appears in the cohort visualization. |
| | Cohort Palette | The color palette used in the cohort visualization. |

| | Display barbells on lines | Show barbells on lines in Combo charts. |
| **[Key Metric Summary](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/key-metric.md)** | | |
| | Summary display type | <ul><li>Emphasize percent change</li><li>Emphasize number value</li></ul> |
| | Show sparklines | how or hide line charts at the bottom of the chart. When hidden, the legend changes to no longer visually reference the lines. |
| | Show max and min on sparklines | Show minimum and maximum values on primary and comparison line charts. |
| | Show comparison | Show comparison data. When hidden, both the comparison line chart and summary change objects are hidden from view. |
| | Number value options | In the [!UICONTROL **Key Metric Summary**] section <ul><li>Show percent change</li><li>Show raw difference</li>Raw difference between the total value of the metric in the primary date range and the secondary date range</ul> |
| **[Fallout](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/fallout/configuring-fallout.md)** | | |
| | Container | Switch between Visit and Visitor to analyze visitor pathing. The default is Visitor.

| | Wrap labels | Normally, the labels on the Flow elements are truncated to save screen real estate, but you can make the entire label visible by checking this box. Default = unchecked. |
| | Include repeat instances | Flow visualizations are based on instances of a dimension. This setting gives you the option to include or exclude repeated instances, for example, Page reloads. However, repeats cannot be removed from Flow visualizations that include multi-valued dimensions, such as listVars, listProps, s.product, merchandising eVars, etc. Default = unchecked. |
| | Show tooltips | Determines whether tooltips, containing node data, are shown when you hover over individual nodes within a flow visualization. |
| | Number of columns | Determines how many columns you want in your Flow diagram. |
| | Items expanded per column | How many items you want in each column. |
| **Stacked Charts** | | |
| | 100% stacked | This setting on area stacked, bar stacked or horizontal bar stacked visualizations turns the chart into a "100% stacked" visualization. <p>For more information, see [Bar and bar stacked](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/bar.md).</p> |
| **[Histogram](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/histogram.md)** | | |
| | Number of buckets | Choose the number of data ranges (buckets) in the visualization. The maximum number of buckets is 50. <p>For more information, see [Histogram](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/histogram.md).</p> |
