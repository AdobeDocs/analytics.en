# End-of-life for Adobe Data Connectors

For more than a decade, Adobe Analytics has aimed to provide the best-in-class web & marketing analytics solution to meet customers' needs. As technology and business needs evolve, we strive to continually deliver and meet the highest standards.  Unfortunately, the APIs that power this integration no longer meet those standards and are not tenable in modern Adobe Analytics technology infrastructure.

Effective August 1, 2021, Adobe intends to discontinue Data Connectors Integrations. End-of-life is part of any technology product's lifecycle and Adobe intends to make the transition as seamless as possible for our customers and partners. Many of these integrations are available via Adobe Exchange and can continue to be utilized.  

## Why are we end-of-lifing this feature?

This feature is powered by legacy technology that is no longer viable or supported. We have a new standard in the [Adobe Exchange Partner Program](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud) that should be adopted for any integrations that wish to continue to be offered and supported. 

## How does removal of this feature impact you?

If you are an Adobe Partner, details on migrating your integration to our new Adobe Exchange program can found [here](https://adobeexchangeec.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003867071-Adobe-Analytics-Integration-Tools) in our documentation.  

If you are a Data Connector customer and want to request that the integration you use should be migrated, you should *route all requests directly to the Integration Partner*. Sending a request to Adobe via Customer Care will not have the same desired effect.

Each company providing an integration was given the option to migrate their integration to Adobe Exchange or discontinue their integration. Below is a summary of each current integration and their accompanying decision.

For additional questions or support, please reach out to Adobe Customer Care.
