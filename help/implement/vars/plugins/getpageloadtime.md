# Adobe plug-in: getPageLoadTime

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This plug-in is no longer supported. Its code uses the [`PerformanceTiming`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming) interface, which is deprecated on most modern browsers.

The `getPageLoadTime` plug-in used the JavaScript performance object to allow you to measure the amount of time a page takes to completely load. Since this plug-in is no longer supported, installation instructions and plug-in code are no longer available.
