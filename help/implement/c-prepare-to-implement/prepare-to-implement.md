<!-- # Prepare to implement Analytics

The following sections contain tasks you should complete and information you should gather when preparing to implement Analytics.

The information and documents in this section are gathered directly from Adobe Consulting. Following these guidelines and filling out the provided questionnaires will help you implement Analytics, whether you implement by yourself or work with Adobe Consulting (recommended).

If you are working with an Adobe Consultant, it is not required that you know the information in these documents before implementing Analytics. However, being familiar with the documents Consulting will create and the questions they will ask can help to speed up the pre-implementation process. -->
