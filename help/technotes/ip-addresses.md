# IPs and domains used by Adobe Analytics

Some firewall configurations block IP addresses originating from Adobe's data collection servers or servers responsible for accessing data. You can use this list of ranges to alter your organization's firewall settings to allow access and to send data from within your organization. This page includes both inbound systems (such as data collection) and outbound systems (such as data feeds) that Adobe uses.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>While Adobe does its best to keep this document current, it cannot guarantee that the list of IP ranges remains the same. Possible changes include growth and expansion of the business, an internet registry requires changes to Adobe's IP address space, or an internet service provider stops functioning.
