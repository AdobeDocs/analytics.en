This can help you see if they continued to use the same referrer, and view patterns in how customers are referred to your site. You can view the number of visitors generated by an original referrer or discover how much revenue each original referrer was responsible for producing. <span class="wintitle"> Referrer</span> reports can be populated each time a visitor comes to your site, even if the visitor comes to the site multiple times during a session (before the visit expires.) </p> </td>

   <td colname="col1"> Referrers </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p> Displays the domain or URL where your visitors came from before they arrived at your site, the methods visitors use to find your website, and the number of visits to your site that came from these referring locations. </p> <p>For example, if a visitor clicks a link from Site A and arrives at your site, Site A is the referrer if it is not defined as part of your domain. During implementation, your implementation consultant can help you to define the domains and URLs that are part of your website (this can also be done after implementation.) Any domains or URLs that are not part of those defined domains and URLs are considered referrers. </p> <p>For example, if web page A and web page B are added to the internal URL filter, but web page C is not, then web page C is considered a referrer. </p> <p>See <a href="/help/admin/admin/internal-url-filter-admin.md"> Internal URL Filters</a></p>  <p>Note: Analytics records a referring domain as an email when visitors click an emailed message link containing the protocol <code> imap://</code> or <span class="filepath"> mail://</span> and arrive at your site. </p> <p>For example, anything coming from <code> https://mail.yahoo.com</code> is not counted as an email referrer because the protocol is <span class="filepath"> https://</span>. Emails from Outlook are reported in the <span class="wintitle"> Typed/ Bookmarked</span> line. Any referrer with an HTTP protocol where the domain is a known search engine is reported in the <span class="wintitle"> Search Engine</span> line. </p> </td>
