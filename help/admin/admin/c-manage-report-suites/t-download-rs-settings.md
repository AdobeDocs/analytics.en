# Download report suite settings

To generate a tab-delimited file containing all the settings for the selected report suite:

1.  Click **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Report Suites]**.

2.  Select a report suite from the [!UICONTROL Report Suite] table.

3.  Click **[!UICONTROL Download]**.

    A file named Report Suite Data.tab is downloaded to your local computer.

   You can open the file in any text editor that can handle tab-delimited files. 
   
>[!NOTE]
>
>   If you want to properly open the file in a spreadsheet program like Excel, you must modify the file before doing so. The first row does not have a value for the first column which prevents proper import of the file in programs like Excel.
