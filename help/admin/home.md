# Analytics Admin Guide

![Banner](/assets/doc_banner_admin.png)

This help is intended for administrators of Adobe Analytics. It includes help on user and product management in the Admin Console, setting up report suites, variables, classifications, and data collection. 

Adobe Analytics currently has two areas for administrators:

* Adobe Admin Console: Use this area for provisioning Experience Cloud tools, and managing user permissions. It is located at [adminconsole.adobe.com](https://adminconsole.adobe.com).
* Analytics Admin Console: Use this area for report suite and variable management. It can be accessed by clicking Admin in the top header of Adobe Analytics.

This guide covers:

* All tasks that are done in the Analytics Admin Console. This area includes setting up report suites, variables, classifications, or data governance. See [Admin Tools](admin/c-admin-tools.md) for a list of report suite and company settings available.
* All Analytics-specific tasks that are done in the Adobe Admin Console. This area includes product provisioning and user permission management. See [Adobe Analytics in the Adobe Admin Console](admin-console/home.md) for a list of actions that can be done in the Adobe Admin Console.

This guide does not cover many of the generic capabilities that the Adobe Admin Console offers. Instead, see [Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-console.html) in the Enterprise user guide.
