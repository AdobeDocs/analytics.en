# Bounce Rate

Shows the percentage of visits that contain a single hit.

Bounce rate uses the [Bounces](/help/components/c-variables/c-metrics/metrics-bounces.md) metric and is calculated as:

`Bounces divided by Entries`

Bounce Rate does not include visits where multiple actions occurred on a single page. For example, a visit with a video view on a single page is a Single Access but not a Bounce.

> [!NOTE] Existing implementations can sometimes contain a calculated metric that differs from the Analytics default metric. Check the calculated metric definition to make sure there are no differences.

See this [Knowledgebase article](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/home/index.html#kb-analytics-comparing-bounces-and-single-access) for more information.
