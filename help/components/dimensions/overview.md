# Dimensions overview

Dimensions are variables in Adobe Analytics that typically contain string values. Common dimensions include [Page](page.md), [Referring domain](referring-domain.md), or an [eVar](evar.md). In contrast, [metrics](../metrics/overview.md) contain numeric values that tie to a dimension. A basic report shows rows of string values (dimension), against a column of numeric values (metric).

For example, if you combined the 'Page' dimension with the 'Visits' metric, you would get a ranked report showing your top-visited pages:

| `Page` | `Visits` |
| --- | --- |
| `Home page` | `800` |
| `Product page` | `500` |
| `Purchase page` | `100` |

Each dimension represents a different part or facet of your site. You can combine one of more of these dimensions with one or more metric to create a desired report.
