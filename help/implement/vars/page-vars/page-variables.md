# Page variables

Page variables determine the values for dimensions and metrics in reporting.

The following list are variables frequently used in implementations:

* [`pageName`](pagename.md): The name of the page.
* [`campaign`](campaign.md): Set this variable to a query string parameter for campaign tracking.
* [`events`](events/events-overview.md): Populate metrics for use in reporting.
* [`products`](products.md): If you have an eCommerce site, set this variable when a visitor views or purchases a product.
