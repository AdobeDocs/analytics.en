# Integration Overview{#integration-overview}

Describes the integration capabilities at a high level.

The integration of ContactLab and Adobe Analytics enables current ContactLab customers to increase returns from e-mail marketing. It allows you to understand campaign effectiveness from almost any angle, and then remarket to customers based on cart abandonment, product purchases, product views and more.

This integration automatically synchronizes e-mail metrics with Adobe Analytics for closed-loop marketing to the right audience with maximum effectiveness.
