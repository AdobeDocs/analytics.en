# Funnel features

The Funnel visualization includes features to build a funnel with multiple dimensions, raw visitor numbers, and a percentage of visitors at each step across three separate scopes.

Here are the basic features of the funnel visualization.

## Advanced funnel options {#section_DA6DA1B641A245299609F01F27EBE040}

Below are additional features to set up and view the funnel visualization:

* **Drag more elements**. Add more elements to your funnel by dragging and dropping them from the Dimension table to the funnel using the **Ctrl** + **Alt** keys. You can drag multiple steps at the same time from the Dimension table by selecting multiple items (using **Ctrl** + click) and then dragging them to the Funnel visualization using the **Ctrl** + **Alt** keys.. 

* **Delete a step**: Delete elements by right-clicking on the step in the visualization and clicking **Yes**.

  ![](assets/funnel_path_browser_4.png)

* **Rearrange the steps you have dragged to the funnel**. Simply click the step to select it and drag it to another position to rearrange the steps. 
* **Open a Path Browser**. You can see more detail about where customers fall through or fall out of the process through the [Add a Path Browser](../../c-analysis-vis/c-funnel-visualization/c-path-browser-funnel.md#concept_B0CEDF7A28AE422696DED1258C9A4119) feature. 

* **Add more steps**. You can add a maximum of eight steps to each funnel visualization. 
* **Change the metric**. The metric can be changed so the steps are counting visits or some other metric at each step. Available options vary by dataset. 
* **Display in a tabular view**. Right-click the title to display the Funnel Visualization menu and click **[!UICONTROL Show Tabular View]**. Once in tabular view, you can select **[!UICONTROL Show Graph View]** to return to graphic representation of the funnel. To open the Tabular View, right-click on the title and select Show Tabular View from the menu. 

* **Compare sequences**. An efficient way to compare two similar sequences is to display their two visualizations side-by-side. You can also display both the tabular view and the graph view side-by-side using the Duplicate feature. To open, right-click on the title and select Duplicate from the menu.
