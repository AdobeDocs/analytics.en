# Traffic Sources

Displays information about the places on the Web that drive traffic to your site. You can see which search engines and web sites outside your domain send visitors to you.

## Traffic Sources {#topic_6718F8EFD5984DC5839B9E8F6CC45EDA}

Displays information about the places on the Web that drive traffic to your site. You can see which search engines and web sites outside your domain send visitors to you. 

The reports in this menu fall into three basic categories:

* Search keywords 
* Search engines 
* Referrers and referring domains

### Search Keywords - All, Paid, or Natural

Displays a breakdown of each search keyword that has been used to find your site. You can sort this list by page views or search keywords by clicking the column title above the listing. Click the magnifying glass next to a search keyword to see the search results for your site. 

### Search Engines - All, Paid, or Natural

Displays which search engines that people are using to find your web page. The graph shows you the percentage breakdown of the search engines that are used to find your site. 

**All Search Page Rankings**

Displays the rank of your site from among all listings for your visitor’s searches, including paid and natural search page ranking data.

For example, a user who comes to your site from a search engine might have seen you on the third of one hundred pages of results. This can help you quickly see and optimize search engine efforts. Data for this report can be viewed for all but the Hourly time period. 

### Referring domains and referrers

**Referring Domains**

Shows the domains that referred the customers that most impacted your site’s success metrics. Referrers fall into two main categories: Domains and URLs. Domains refer to the domain name, and appear as the base domain without the query string or subdirectories attached. URLs include the base domain name, as well as any query strings or subdirectories. 

**Original Referring Domains**

Displays the original referrers that produced the customers on your site. Customers can visit your site multiple times, and have a different referrer for each visit. 

This report is useful to see how visitors were referred the first time they arrived at your site. This can help you see if they continued to use the same referrer, and view patterns in how customers are referred to your site. You can view the number of visitors generated by an original referrer or discover how much revenue each original referrer was responsible for producing. Referrer reports can be populated each time a visitor comes to your site, even if the visitor comes to the site multiple times during a session (before the visit expires.)

**Referrers**

Displays the domain or URL where your visitors came from before they arrived at your site, the methods visitors use to find your website, and the number of visits to your site that came from these referring locations. 

For example, if a visitor clicks a link from Site A and arrives at your site, Site A is the referrer if it is not defined as part of your domain. During implementation, your implementation consultant can help you to define the domains and URLs that are part of your website (this can also be done after implementation.) Any domains or URLs that are not part of those defined domains and URLs are considered referrers.

For example, if web page A and web page B are added to the internal URL filter, but web page C is not, then web page C is considered a referrer. 

See [Internal URL Filters](/help/admin/admin/internal-URL-filter-admin.md)

>[!NOTE]
>
>Analytics records a referring domain as an email when visitors click an emailed message link containing the protocol `imap://` or `mail://` and arrive at your site.
>
>For example, anything coming from <code> https://mail.yahoo.com</code> is not counted as an email referrer because the protocol is `https://`. Emails from Outlook are reported in the  `Typed/ Bookmarked` line. Any referrer with an HTTP protocol where the domain is a known search engine is reported in the `Search Engine` line. 

**Referrer Types**

By tracking and recording the visitors’ referring sites for each visit, you can determine how visitors found out about your site for each visit. The list below defines the various types of referrers.

* Hard drive referrers are recorded when visitors click a link in an HTML document located on their own hard drive and arrive at your site as a result.
* Other website referrers are recorded when visitors click a link located on a page on another website (not defined as part of your site) and arrive at your website.
* Search engine referrers are recorded when visitors use a search engine to access your site. * Typed / Bookmarked referrers are recorded when visitors type your site’s URL directly into their browser, or if they access your site by selecting bookmarks.
