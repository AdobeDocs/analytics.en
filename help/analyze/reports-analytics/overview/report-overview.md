# Report Features

An introduction to the features of a report, including the toolbar, calendar, and detail table.

This example shows a [!UICONTROL Pages Report]. The configuration options may vary, depending on the report that you run. For example, rather than selecting Trended or Ranked in a [!UICONTROL Site Content] report, you might specify the granularity and page name for a [!UICONTROL Site Metrics] report.

## Example Pages Report {#section_288CC85536684C2DB184141358481EF0}

An example of a Pages Report ( **[!UICONTROL Reports]** > **[!UICONTROL Site Content]** > **[!UICONTROL Pages Reports]** > **[!UICONTROL Pages]**).

## Graph Display {#section_4C78ADC82C234CC6841AC92C803636F4}

Depending on the type of graph that you have selected, you typically see the top several items from the details list. If your graph is a trended graph showing different time periods, then all of the time periods display:

## Detail Table {#section_449A5DC848744F65A10DA12E189B835D}

The details are the bulk of the report data. In this case, you have pages listed, and they are being measured by Page Views, which is how many times they were loaded during the period:

In the detail table, you can filter data, create breakdowns, add metrics, and more.
