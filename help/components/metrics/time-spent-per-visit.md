## How this metric is calculated

## Percentages above 100%

This metric frequently contains percentages above 100%. The denominator is the entire dimension's time spent per visit, and the numerator is the dimension value's time spent per visit. If the entire dimension's time spent per visit is lower than a given dimension value's time spent per visit, you'll see percentages above 100%. Sorting ranked reports by this metric shows anomaly time spent per visit values, which is typically not valuable. Adobe recommends sorting by another metric, such as [Visits](visits.md), in ranked reports.
