# View annotations

Annotations manifest slightly differently, depending on whether they span a single day or a date range.

## View annotations in Line charts or Tables

| Date | Appearance |
| --- | --- |
| **Single day** |   ![](assets/single-day.png)<p>When you hover over the annotation, you can see its details, you can edit it by selecting the pen icon, or you can delete it:<p> ![](assets/hover.png) |
| **Date range** |  The icon changes and when you hover over it, the date range appears.<p>![](assets/multi-day.png)<p>When you select it in the line chart, the annotation metadata appear, and you can edit or delete it:![](assets/multi-hover.png)<p>In a table, an icon appears on every date in the date range.<p>![](assets/multi-day-table.png)|
| **Overlapping annotations** | On days that have more than one annotation tied to them, the icon appears in a grey color.<p>![](assets/grey.png)<p>When you hover over the grey icon, all overlapping annotations appear:<p>![](assets/overlap.png) |

## View annotations in a .pdf file

Since you cannot hover over icons in a .pdf file, this file (after export) provides notes of explanations at the bottom of a panel. Here is an example:

## View annotations with non-trended data

Sometimes annotation are shown with non-trended data, but tied to a specific dimension. In that case, they appear only in a summary annotation in the bottom right corner. Here is an example:

![](assets/non-date.png)

The summary chart appears in all visualization types in the corner, not just in non-trended freeform tables and summary numbers. It also appears in visualizations like [!UICONTROL Donut], [!UICONTROL Flow],[!UICONTROL Fallout],[!UICONTROL Cohort], and so on.
