# Marketing channel detail

The 'Marketing channel detail' dimension functions identically to the ['Last touch channel detail'](last-touch-detail.md) dimension. Adobe introduced this dimension for use in reports that use custom attribution. Users who viewed custom attribution marketing channel reports were confused with the 'last touch' label, as 'last touch' is not accurate with custom attribution. Adobe introduced the generic 'Marketing channel detail' dimension so analysts can build custom attribution marketing channel reports without the misleading 'last touch' dimension label.
