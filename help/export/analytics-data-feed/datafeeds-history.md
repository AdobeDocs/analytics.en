# Data Feed release notes

Cumulative release notes for Analytics data feed.

## July, 2018 {#section_7C60C222EAF740B9B3D842E7832629CB}

Complete update and rewrite of the Data Column Reference.

## January 19, 2017 - New User Interface and Service Name {#section_1CD29EF425AE40A4896DFA097E9E3A62}

There is now a user interface for data feeds and job management. Until now, Data Feed administrators had to rely on Adobe Customer Care to get a status update on their Data Feed jobs. This is no longer the case. The Data Feed user interface is now available to all Adobe Analytics administrators.

With this release, the name of the service has changed from Clickstream Data Feeds to Analytics Data Feed.
