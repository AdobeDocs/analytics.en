# eVarN

The [!UICONTROL eVar] variables are used for building custom reports.


<!-- 

eVarN.xml

 -->

When an eVar is set to a value for a visitor, the value is remembered until it expires. Any success events that a visitor encounters while the eVar value is active are counted toward the eVar value.

|  Max Size  | Debugger Parameter  | Reports Populated  | Default Value  |
|---|---|---|---|
|  255 Bytes  | V1-v75 ( [or v100 or v250](/help/implement/js-implementation/page-variables/page-variables.md))  | Custom Conversion  | ""  |

**Expiration**

`eVars` expire after a time period you specify. After the eVar expires, it no longer receives credit for success events. eVars can also be configured to expire on success events. For example, if you have an internal promotion that expires at the end of a visit, the internal promotion receives credit only for purchases or registrations that occur during the visit in which they were activated.

There are two ways to expire an eVar:

* You can set the eVar to expire after a specified time period or event.
* You can use force the expiration of an eVar, which is useful when repurposing a variable.

If an eVar is used in May to reflect internal promotions and expires after 21 days, and in June it is used to capture internal search keywords, then on June 1, you should force the expiration of, or reset, the variable. Doing so will help keep internal promotion values out of June's reports.

**Case Sensitivity**

eVars are case insensitive, but they are displayed in the capitalization of the first occurrence. For example, if the first instance of eVar1 is set to "Logged In," but all subsequent instances are passed as "logged in," reports always show "Logged In" as the value of the eVar.

**Counters**

While eVars are most often used to hold string values, they may also be configured to act as counters. eVars are useful as counters when you are trying to count the number of actions a user takes before an event. For example, you may use an eVar to capture the number of internal searches before purchase. Each time a visitor searches, the eVar should contain a value of '+1.' If a visitor searches four times before a purchase, you will see an instance for each total count: 1.00, 2.00, 3.00, and 4.00. However, only the 4.00 receives credit for the purchase event (Orders and Revenue Metrics). Only positive numbers are allowed as values of an eVar counter.

**Subrelations**

A common requirement for a Custom eVar report is the ability to break down one Custom eVar report by another. For example, if one eVar contains gender, and another contains salary, you may ask the following question: of the female visitors to my site, how much revenue was generated by women who make more than $50,000 per year. Any eVar that is fully sub-related allows this type of break down in reports. For example, if the gender eVar has full subrelations enabled, all other custom eVar reports can be broken down by gender, and gender can be broken down by all others. To see the relationship between two reports, only one of them needs full subrelations enabled. By default, Campaign, Products, and Category reports are fully sub-related (any eVar can be broken down by campaign or products).

**Syntax and Possible Values**

While eVars may be renamed, they should always be referred to in the JavaScript file by eVarX, where X is a number between 1 and 75 ( [or 100, or 250](/help/implement/js-implementation/page-variables/page-variables.md)).

```js
s.eVarX="value"
```

When not used as a counter, eVars have the same limitations as all other variables. If the eVar is a "counter," it is expected to receive numeric values like "1" or "2.5." If more than two decimal places are given, the eVar counter rounds to two decimal places. An eVar counter may not contain negative numbers.

**Examples**

```js
s.eVar1="logged in"
```

```js
s.eVar23="internal spring promo 4"
```

**Configuration Settings**

eVars can be configured in Analytics > Admin > Report Suites > Edit Settings > Conversion > Conversion Variables]. All eVars can be configured with a Name, Type, Allocation, Expire After Setting, or Reset. Each configuration setting is addressed separately.

**Pitfalls, Questions, and Tips**

* Unlike [!UICONTROL prop] variables, eVar variables are not allowed to be lists of delimited values. If you populate an eVar with a list of values, for example "one,two,three," then that exact string appears in reports.
* eVar counters may not contain negative numbers.

## Additional eVars and events

If you want to track additional information, but don't have enough variables to do so, you now have access to additional eVars and success events:

> [!NOTE] JavaScript H-Code does not support these additional eVars and events.

## Populating Variables and Events {#section_DEA51A22BCBB4B92BDD25814AAD296E4}

* Variables can be populated in the data collection library if you are using these versions of [!DNL AppMeasurement]:

    * AppMeasurement for JavaScript version 1.4+ 
    * AppMeasurement for Flash version 3.9+ 
    * AppMeasurement for Java version 1.2.8+ 
    * AppMeasurement for Silverlight/.NET version 1.4.2+ 
    * AppMeasurement for PHP version 1.2.2+

* If you are on an earlier version of code, or on JavaScript H.&#42;, you can populate context data and use processing rules to populate variables.
* All versions of data collection code can populate events 101-1000.
* Processing rules can be used to populate eVars 76-250 based on context data or other variables.

# Comparing Props and eVars

There are several types of variables available in the Experience Cloud. The two most popular types, Props and eVars, allow your organization to report on custom dimensions to your site that standard out-of-the-box reports do not offer.

When determining which variables are assigned where, it is important to understand the differences between Prop and eVar functionality. Understanding these differences allows your organization to decide which type of variable is best to use.

**Props vs eVars**

The following are the main differences between props and eVars:

* **Naming convention**: Props are considered traffic variables, meaning they are used to report on popularity of various dimensions of your site. eVars are considered conversion variables. They are used to determine which dimensions of your site contribute the most to success events.
* **Persistence**: Props do not persist beyond the image request they were fired on. They cannot be associated with other variables that are not in the same image request. eVars, however, are persistent. A back-end variable is used to preserve the value originally fired so it can associate itself with success events later on.
* **Success events**: Success events, also known as conversion events, are metrics that measure the number of times a visitor reaches a goal. This event can be anything from purchasing something on your site, to subscribing to a newsletter. eVars are designed to report on conversion events, to show you which values are most successful in influencing visitors to reach your goals. Traffic variables do not have this same functionality. However, you can view participation metrics if you configure your report suite correctly.
* **Pathing**: Props can use pathing, which allows your organization to see a given path a user took within the context of the variable being viewed. An Adobe representative can enable pathing, if requested. eVars cannot use pathing.
* **Potentially available metrics**: The metrics available between props and eVars vary widely based on the variable's settings and data platform/version. The following list illustrates what can be enabled, not what is enabled by default. If you want a specific metric in reporting but do not see it, have one of your organization's supported users contact Customer Care.

* **Breakdowns**: Props use correlations, which display page views for other traffic variables fired in the same image request. eVars use subrelations, which provide a breakdown on other conversion variables in relation to success events.

## Exclusive advantages to Props or eVars {#section_B384031AB8674065BA5187B0A3A3DAB9}

With the release of version 15, the capabilities between Props and eVars are much less distinct. eVars have recently been updated to include capabilities such as visits/unique visitors with minimal processing load, as well as pathing metrics.

Props hold a couple advantages of eVars, some of which can be circumvented:

* Prop data is collected and available in reporting almost instantly. eVars can take upwards of 30 minutes to appear in report suite data.
* All Props can have flowchart-like reports enabled, which let you see the path visitors take to your site. These pathing flow reports are available for both Props and eVars in [!UICONTROL Ad Hoc Analysis].
* Props can be correlated multiple levels, where eVars can only be subrelated once. This limitation can be mitigated by using segmentation, giving identical data as correlations.
* Participation metrics allow you to see what prop values participated before a success event.

eVars on the other hand hold several advantages over the limited nature of Props:

* eVars can use success events as metrics. Props cannot.
* eVar expiration can be customized, including having an expiration of every hit (no persistent values whatsoever). Props don't persist in any way.

Pathing metrics, such as Total Time Spent, Entries, and Exits, were originally not available for eVars. However, recent updates have made these metrics available, increasing the value of eVars.

## Which to Use {#section_022D016A4EEB45179A15BFF044A261A4}

**Props:** If latency is the largest concern, and you intend to only measure traffic (not success events) with this dimension.

**eVars:** If data breakdowns and relationships are the largest concerns.

>[!TIP]
>
>If you don't want an eVar to persist, you can change its expiration to 'hit' so it doesn't keep any data beyond the hit.

# Conversion variables (eVars)

The Custom Insight Conversion Variable (or eVar) is placed in the Adobe code on selected web pages of your site. Its primary purpose is to segment conversion success metrics in custom marketing reports.

eVars are best used to measure cause and effect, such as:

* Which internal campaigns influenced revenue 
* Which banner ads ultimately resulted in a registration 
* The number of times an internal search was used before making an order

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>When implementing Analytics, it is important to know which eVars you will use, and how many. You should also understand how to configure those eVars in the Admin Console. For detailed information about eVars, see [Conversion Variables (eVar)](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/conversion_var_admin.html) in the Analytics Help and reference documentation.

An eVar can be visit-based and function similarly to cookies. Values passed into eVar variables follow the user for a predetermined period of time.

When an eVar is set to a value for a visitor, Adobe automatically remembers that value until it expires. Any success events that a visitor encounters while the eVar value is active are counted toward the eVar value.

> [!NOTE] Only a single value can be stored in an eVar in an image request. If multiple values are desired in an eVar value, we recommend that you implement [List variables](/help/implement/js-implementation/page-variables/listvariable.md) (list vars).
