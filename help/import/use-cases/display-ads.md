# Integrate Google Display Ad data with Adobe Analytics

This integration lets you associate customer behavior with campaign and cost data from Google AdWords.

1. Log in to Google Campaign Manager.
2. Set up a recurring export of your display ad so that you can upload deltas of your display metrics (impressions, clicks, cost), broken down by the most granular ID (Ad ID).
3. Upload the full set of Ad ID metadata, like campaign, site, etc.
4. Classify the Ad ID using all the metadata.
5. Format them into formats that can be used by data sources and classifications.
6. from this point on, like paid search...
