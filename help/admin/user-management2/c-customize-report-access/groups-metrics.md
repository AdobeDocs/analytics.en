**Solution Events**

In addition to [Custom Events](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/implement/events.html), this category includes Analytics solution events, including Experience Manager (AEM), Media Optimizer (AMO), Mobile, Video, and Social.). Every custom group with any metrics will have all Analytics solution events added as new metrics.

You can set permissions to Custom Events and Analytics solution events (AEM, AMO, Mobile, Video, and Social).

Every custom group with any metrics will have all Analytics Solution events added as new metrics.

See [Metric Descriptions](metrics.md#concept_EB00207C07BD4481AB116E62EC24E686) for information about metrics used in Analytics.

**Content Aware**

Content Aware includes variables that let you manage the permissions on metrics related to Experience Cloud solution integrations. You can manage permissions on [!DNL Social], [!DNL Mobile], or any other data that was inserted through a [!DNL Experience Cloud] integration. These will be enabled by default.
