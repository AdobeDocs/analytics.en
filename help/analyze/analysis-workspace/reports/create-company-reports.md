# Create and manage custom company reports

You can create custom reports and save them for others in your login company to use. Company reports are available to choose when creating a project, as described in [Create a project from a blank project or a report](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/create-projects.md#create-a-project-from-a-blank-project-or-a-report) in the article, [Create projects in Analysis Workspace](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/create-projects.md).

## Create a custom company report

To create a new Company report:

1. Build a project in Analysis Workspace to your desired state.
1. Select [!UICONTROL **Project**] > **[!UICONTROL Save as company reportâ€¦]**.
