# Calculated metrics workflow

Learn about the steps to take for creating calculated metrics.

| Workflow Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Plan Calculated Metrics | Especially for metrics that are going to be officially "approved", it makes sense to outline which calculated metrics will be widely used and how they will be defined. |
| [Build](c-build-metrics/cm-build-metrics.md) Calculated Metrics | Build and edit calculated and advanced calculated metrics for use in [!DNL Analytics] components.  See [examples](c-build-metrics/cm-build-metrics.md) of how to build calculated metrics. |
| [Tag](cm-tagging.md) Calculated Metrics | Tag calculated metrics for ease of organization and sharing. See how to plan and assign tags for simple and advanced searches and organization. |
| [Approve](cm-approving.md) Calculated Metrics | Approve calculated metrics to make them canonical. |
| Apply Calculated Metrics | You can apply metrics directly from a report, from the Metric Selector (to access it, click  Show Metrics). |
| [Share](cm-sharing.md) Calculated Metrics | Share your metrics with the intended audience in other [!DNL Analytics] tools and to Adobe Target and the Adobe Experience Cloud. |
| Filter Calculated Metrics | In the Metric Selector, click  Advanced Selection and filter by tags, owners, and other filters (Show All, Mine, Shared With me, Favorites, and Approved.) |
| Mark Calculated Metrics as [Favorites](cm-finding.md) | Marking metrics as favorites is another way to organize them for ease of use.|
