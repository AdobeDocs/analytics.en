# Combo chart

The [!UICONTROL Combo chart] visualization makes it easy to quickly build a comparison visualization without having to build a table first. You can easily view trends in your data in a line/bar combination. 

Use a Combo chart to 

* Compare this week's orders to orders at the same time last month (and last year) - all within a few clicks. 

* Quickly analyze and compare multiple metrics (like [!UICONTROL Unique Visitors] and [!UICONTROL Revenue]) against one another on the same chart. 

* Analyze a metric against a function (such as [!UICONTROL Cumulative Average]) over a time horizon.

## Build a Combo chart

1. From the Visualizations drop-down list in the left rail, drag the [!UICONTROL Combo chart] visualization into a blank panel.

1. From the drop-down lists, select a dimension for the X-axis and a metric for the Y-axis.

1. Select the type of [!UICONTROL Line comparison] you want to use.

   | Line comparison type | Definition |
   | --- | --- |
   | Time period | The most common type of comparison - comparing this time period to 4 weeks ago, for example. If you selected Time period, make a secondary selection as to which time period you want to compare.<p>![](assets/combo-time-period.png)|
   | Additional metric | You could, for example, compare [!UICONTROL Revenue] to another metric. |
   | Function | You could introduce a function like [!UICONTROL Average] into the comparison. |

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Build]**.

   The output will look similar to this:
