# Customer Attributes

An Analytics FAQ for customer attributes, and how to run the Customer Attributes report.

**[!UICONTROL Reports]** **[!UICONTROL > Visitor Profile]** > **[!UICONTROL Customer Attributes]**

If you capture enterprise customer data in a customer relationship management (CRM) database, you can upload the data into a customer attribute data source in the Experience Cloud. After the data is uploaded, you can run the Customer Attributes report in Reports & Analytics.

See [Customer Attributes](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/attributes.html) in Experience Cloud help for information about uploading customer attribute data.

## Customer Attributes and Reporting Metrics in Analytics {#section_EF343662146B460A882D3DF772ADD86D}

After you upload customer attributes and validate the schema (in the Experience Cloud), the system creates metrics based on the friendly names (like *`age`* or *`gender`*) that you map to the attribute strings and integers. These metrics appear in **[!UICONTROL Visitor Profile]** > **[!UICONTROL Customer Attributes]** reports.

For example:

**[!UICONTROL Visitor Profile]** > **[!UICONTROL Customer Attributes]** > **[!UICONTROL Age]**

**Example - Age Metrics**

If you specify a string as *`age`*, the system creates the following metrics and dimensions:

* Age dimension: Lets you run a report based on the Age attribute.
* Age metric: A metric you can add to a report, such as a Unique Visitors report.
* Count of Age metric: Lets you understand, for example, if visitors specified an *`age`* value on a form.

Because metrics are sums in a report table, you should [create a calculated metric](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/calcmetrics/) that tells you the average age. The formula for this metric is `Age / Count of Age`.

The Identity Service synchronizes the Customer ID with the Experience Cloud immediately. </li>
