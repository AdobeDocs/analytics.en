# trackingServer

Adobe collects data on your site by receiving an image request generated by the visitor. The `trackingServer` variable determines the location an image request is sent. If this variable is not defined correctly, your implementation can experience data loss.

>[!WARNING]
>
>Changing this value makes AppMeasurement look for cookies in a different location. Unique visitor count can temporarily spike in reporting as visitor cookies are set in the new location.

## Edge domain using the Web SDK extension

The Web SDK uses [!UICONTROL Edge domain] to handle both Tracking Server and Secure Tracking Server. You can set the desired [!UICONTROL Edge domain] value when configuring the Web SDK extension.

1. Log in to [Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](https://experience.adobe.com/data-collection) using your AdobeID credentials.
1. Click the desired tag property.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click the **[!UICONTROL Configure]** button under [!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK].
1. Set the desired **[!UICONTROL Edge domain]** text field.

See [Configure the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK extension](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/extension/web-sdk-extension-configuration.html) in the Web SDK documentation for more information.

>[!TIP]
>
>If your organization moves to the Web SDK from an AppMeasurement or Analytics extension implementation, this field can use the same value contained in `trackingServerSecure` (or `trackingServer`).

## Edge domain manually implementing the Web SDK

Configure the SDK using [`edgeDomain`](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/fundamentals/configuring-the-sdk.html). The field is a string that determines the domain to send data to.

```json
alloy("configure", {
  "edgeDomain": "data.example.com"
});
```

## Tracking Server using the Adobe Analytics extension

Tracking Server is a field under the [!UICONTROL General] accordion when configuring the Adobe Analytics extension.

1. Log in to [Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](https://experience.adobe.com/data-collection) using your AdobeID credentials.
2. Click the desired tag property.
3. Go to the [!UICONTROL Extensions] tab, then click the **[!UICONTROL Configure]** button under Adobe Analytics.
4. Expand the [!UICONTROL General] accordion, which reveals the [!UICONTROL Tracking Server] field.

If this field is left blank, it defaults to `[rsid].data.adobedc.net`.

## s.trackingServer in AppMeasurement and the Analytics extension custom code editor

The `s.trackingServer` variable is a string that contains the location to send data.

## Determine the value for `trackingServer`

The value for this variable depends on if you use first-party cookies or third-party cookies. Adobe strongly recommends using first-party cookies in your implementation.

### First-party cookies

If you use a first-party cookie implementation, it is likely that someone in your organization has already completed the first-party cookie process. See [First-party cookies in the Experience Cloud](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/core-services/interface/ec-cookies/cookies-first-party.html) in the Core Services user guide for more information on the first-party cookie process.

The individual who initially configures the first-party cookie implementation also defines the domain and subdomain used. For example:

```js
s.trackingServer = "data.example.com";
```

### Third-party cookies

>[!TIP]
>
>Increasing privacy practices in modern browsers make third-party cookies less reliable. Adobe recommends following the first-party cookie workflow.

If you use a third-party cookie implementation, the value for `trackingServer` is a subdomain of `data.adobedc.net`. For example:

```js
s.trackingServer = "example.data.adobedc.net";
```

Pick a subdomain unique to your organization, unlikely to be picked by another organization that uses Adobe Analytics.  The visitor namespace assigned to your organization is recommended.  Make sure that all implementations in your organization use the same tracking server. It can be helpful to maintain this information in a [solution design document](../../prepare/solution-design.md).

Your organization may already be using a 3rd party tracking server in the `sc.omtrdc.net` or `2o7.net` domains.  These were primarily used in previous versions of Adobe Analytics and are still valid. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Do not use any subdomains deeper than `example.data.adobedc.net`. For example, `custom.example.data.adobedc.net` is not a valid tracking server.
