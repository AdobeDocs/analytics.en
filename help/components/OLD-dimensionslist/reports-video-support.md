description: Groups mobile devices based on the types of video formats they support. For example, if a visitor's mobile device supports .mp4, the Video Support report increments by at least one when it accesses your site. If the phone supports multiple image formats (such as .mp4 and .wmv), each of those groups in the report is incremented. Because of this, the sum of the groups might be greater than the total shown at the bottom of the report.

If the phone supports multiple image formats (such as .mp4 and .wmv), each of those groups in the report is incremented.
