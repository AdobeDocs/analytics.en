# Peering

Private Network Peering enables data to pass from an ISP's network to the Analytics network more efficiently.

Peering is simply the agreement to interconnect and exchange routing information without the need of the public network. Please contact Adobe Engineering if an ISP is interested in establishing a peering relationship.

Although peering may provide some benefits to Adobe ISP customers, optimizing the HTML snippet and the Web servers caching directives likely have a much greater impact. High-volume ISP customers realize the most benefit from peering.
