# End-of-life notice for scheduled reports

Effective April 15, 2022, Adobe intends to pause all scheduled reports that have a creation date greater than two years (any tasks created before January 31, 2020). No reports or data will be deleted. Only reports identified as older than two years will be paused, and no additional scheduled reports will be sent.
 
Any scheduled reports still to be sent can be reactivated by simply logging into Analytics and opening the [!UICONTROL Scheduled Reports] manager. Click the [!UICONTROL Edit] icon and set a new scheduled time and expiration. Any report that gets reactivated will have a default expiration of 9 months, unless a shorter expiration date is chosen.
 
Any report with a creation date less than two years with no expiration date (or with an expiration date longer than two years) will have a default 9-month expiration date applied. The new expiration date will be December 15, 2022. You can edit this expiration date to be less than 9 months, but not greater.
 
Finally, any edits to an existing scheduled report with no expiration date require an expiration date of 9 months or less. Otherwise, you cannot save any edits or changes to the report.
 
At the time of expiration, the scheduled report will be paused. However, the report can be reactivated with a new 9-month expiration date. No reports or data will be deleted.

## New governance policy

The purpose of this action is to effectively manage and maintain our scheduled reports as we prepare for the previously announced end-of-life for Reports & Analytics. This will serve as our new governance policy moving forward: 

* After April 15, 2022, all scheduled reports will have a maximum expiration date of 9 months. 
* After 9 months, expired tasks will be paused and can be reactivated, if still needed, until December 31, 2023. 
* On December 31, 2023, Reports & Analytics will be deprecated.
