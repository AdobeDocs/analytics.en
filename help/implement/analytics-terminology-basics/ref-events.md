# Events

Events keep track of when a visitor has performed a specified action.

An event should be considered a milestone within a site. Success events are most commonly populated on the final confirmation page of a process, such as a registration process or newsletter sign-up.

Common types of events include:

* Success events 
* Currency events 
* Custom events

For detailed information, refer to [Configure Events](events.md#concept_FFD115543D54401B98FE683BD7D5B3FE).

Success events are described in detail in the [Analytics Help and Reference](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/success_event.html).
