# Report Builder reports

Manage license assigned to Report Builder users.

Every Report Builder license assigned to a user is automatically allocated ten scheduled tasks. This number of tasks can be adjusted and reallocated. Scheduled tasks cannot exceed the number of available tasks for each user. Any over-scheduled tasks do not run.

You can grant Report Builder access to any [!DNL Analytics] user by managing product profiles in the [Adobe Admin Console](/help/admin/admin-console/home.md).
