description: Displays path views, or the number of times and percentages that a page was viewed within the constraints of the paths. For example, a Privacy Policy page might have 10,000 total page views, but only 500 of those page views occurred immediately before a Home Page. In this case, you would see 500 path views. You can view the report at the visit or visitor level. Percentages for each page are displayed beside the name of the page. The width of a line connected to a page depicts the relative percentage of visits.

# Next Page Flow

Displays path views, or the number of times and percentages that a page was viewed within the constraints of the paths. For example, a Privacy Policy page might have 10,000 total page views, but only 500 of those page views occurred immediately before a Home Page. In this case, you would see 500 path views. You can view the report at the visit or visitor level. Percentages for each page are displayed beside the name of the page. The width of a line connected to a page depicts the relative percentage of visits.

By default, this report displays the top 10 pages that users went to following the page you select. You can click on any underlined page to further expand the graph. There is no limit to the number of pages you can have on the graph, and you can hover over a page to see visit and revenue data for the page.

Use this report to:

* Understand what steps are taken most frequently after viewing a selected page.
* Optimize your site path design to funnel your traffic to a desired goal page.
* Identify where visitors are going instead of your desired goal pages.
