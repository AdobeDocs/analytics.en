# Display a workspace

After working in Data Workbench, you can display one of the many pre-configured workspaces delivered with Data Workbench.

 The sidebar is a persistent feature of the workspace, unless you hide it. See [Configuring the Sidebar](../../c_get_started/c_config_sidebar.md#concept_41DB771B302E43018E5A9DAA40B397E6).

**To display an existing workspace**

On the desired [!UICONTROL Worktop] tab, click the thumbnail of the workspace you want to display.

>[!NOTE]
>
>After opening a new workspace, you may need to click **[!UICONTROL Add]** > **[!UICONTROL Temporarily Unlock]**.

Below is an example of an open workspace.

**To scroll within a workspace**

With your cursor outside of the workspace, use the scroll wheel on your mouse to scroll through the workspace.
