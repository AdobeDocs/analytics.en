# Adobe Integration: Nightly Data Import{#adobe-integration-nightly-data-import}

The data collection portion of the integration collects click-through and view-through data about site visitors. To obtain DFA click, impression, and cost metrics, there is a nightly process coordinated by Google and Adobe to import this additional data to the integrated report suite. These metrics are imported through Data Sources, meaning they are available in aggregate only, and are not at the visit level. See [Integration Features](../dfa-data-connector-analytics/dfa-integration-features.md#concept-ff93289d1662410e98f62c200394b3e3) for more details.
