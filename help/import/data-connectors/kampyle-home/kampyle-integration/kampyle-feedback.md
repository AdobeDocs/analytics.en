# Mix Feedback and Onsite Behavior Data{#mix-feedback-and-onsite-behavior-data}

You can break down Reports & Analytics reports by feedback dimensions.

Using Adobe Reports & Analytics, you can drill into numerous feedback dimensions that are available in reports. The report below is an example of drilling to a specific Category of feedback and then breaking it down by the feedback Description. Metrics from both Reports & Analytics (Visits & Customer Service Inquiries) and Kampyle (Avg Feedback Grade) are presented side-by-side for easy analysis.
