# Enable a series legend

Elements within a dimension can be color-coded as a series so that each element can be tracked more easily across other visualizations within the workspace.

 **To enable or disable a series legend**

* Right-click an element or the label of the dimension that you want to color-code and click **[!UICONTROL Series Legend]**.

  When the series legend is active, an X appears next to the menu option and the elements within the dimension appear in alternating colors.
