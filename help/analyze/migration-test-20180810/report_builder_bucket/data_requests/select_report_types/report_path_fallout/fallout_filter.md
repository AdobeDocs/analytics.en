# Filter a Fallout Report Using the Request Wizard

This example shows the Page Fallout report.

>1. Select the right report suite.
>1. In the tree view on the left, select ** [!UICONTROL  Paths] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  Page] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  Page Fallout] **.

>       ![](Graphics/page_fallout.png)1. Configure the appropriate [ date ranges](configuring_report_dates.md#concept_4419F6B0BC274DC7A07086DA56703DFE).
>1. Click ** [!UICONTROL  Next] **.
>1. In Step 2 of the Wizard, under ** [!UICONTROL  Row Labels] **, click the ** [!UICONTROL  Define Checkpoints] ** link. (In a fallout report, you always have to define path elements, unlike in a path report, where a pattern is pre-applied.)

>1. In the ** [!UICONTROL  Define Site Section Fallout Checkpoints] ** dialog, define checkpoints from a range of cells or from a list. Then click ** [!UICONTROL  OK] **.
>1. Decide whether to select from a range of cells or from a list.
>1. If you select from a list, click ** [!UICONTROL  Add] ** to select checkpoints to add to the fallout path. You can define between 3 and 8 checkpoints. (Search for available elements by clicking ** [!UICONTROL  More] **.)

>       [ Filter Dimensions](filter_dimensions.md#concept_9C0518E2CF604AADA97DDBB1B4ECAAF8)1. Move ** [!UICONTROL  Available Elements] ** from the left column to the right by selecting them and clicking the orange arrow.
