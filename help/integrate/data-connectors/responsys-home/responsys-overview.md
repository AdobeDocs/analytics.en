# Integration Overview{#integration-overview}

Describes the integration capabilities at a high level.

Adobe Analytics provides an abundance of new targeting opportunities for email marketers using Responsys Interact. By delivering timely, relevant email messages to the dynamic marketing segments identified by Adobe Analytics (formerly SiteCatalyst) can drive increased conversion and revenue from both potential and current customers.

For example, marketers can send an incentive via email to visitors who viewed a particular product or abandoned a shopping cart, encouraging them to return to the site and complete a purchase. The tight integration between marketing reports & analytics and Responsys Interact enables the automation, precise targeting, and closed-loop reporting of these remarketing campaigns, increasing the efficiency of email marketing efforts while boosting web site conversions and measurably improving overall ROI.
