# Annotations overview

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is currently in limited testing.

Annotations enable you to effectively communicate contextual data nuances and insights to your organization. They let you tie calendar events to specific dimensions/metrics. You can annotate a date or date range for data issues, public holidays, campaign launches, etc. You can then graphically display events and see whether campaigns or other events have affected your site traffic, revenue, or any other metric. 

For example, let's say you are sharing projects you created with your organization. You notice a dip or a spike in traffic or other data, and you tie an annotation to the affected metrics, dimensions or segments. These annotations then show up in a table or a line visualization and provide data context for you and the consumers of your Workspace projects.

* Annotations can be tied to a single date or to a date range. 

* They can apply to your entire data set or to specified metrics, dimensions, or segments. 

* They can apply to the project in which they were created (default) or to all projects.

* They can apply to the report suite in which they were created (default) or to all report suites.

## Permissions

By default, only Admins can create annotations. Users have rights to view annotations like they do with other other Analytics components (such as segments, calculated metrics, etc.).

However, Admins can give the [!UICONTROL Annotation Creation] permission (Analytics Tools) to users via the [Adobe Admin Console](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/admin-console/permissions/analytics-tools.html?lang=en).

## View annotations

You can view annotations in a number of ways: as a [!UICONTROL Line] visualization (since it is trended data), as a [!UICONTROL Freeform] table, a [!UICONTROL Bar] chart, or in an exported .pdf file.
