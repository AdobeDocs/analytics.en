# Adobe Analytics first admin guide

Before any users can be assigned roles in Adobe Analytics, a user must be assigned as a first admin in Experience Cloud. The first admin can then provision users in the organization with other key roles.

A first admin is the starting point in enabling the rest of the organization to use each Experience Cloud solution, including Adobe Analytics. 

## Provisioning process for a first admin

After a contract is signed:

1. The provisioning team at Adobe prepares for the account to be created. 

1. The first admin receives an email with login credentials before the contract's start date. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>   Ensuring the first admin's contact info is given to Adobe and accurate before the contract is signed is highly recommended.

## Next steps

After a first admin is provisioned for your organization, the first admin can then provision users in the organization with other key roles. 

For information about how to provision users in your organization with key roles for Adobe Analytics, see [Admin roles in Adobe Analytics](/help/admin/admin-console/admin-roles-in-analytics.md).
