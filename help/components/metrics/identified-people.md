# Identified People

The 'Identified People' metric is a [Cross-Device analytics](../cda/overview.md) metric that counts the number of visitors identified by CDA.

## How this metric is calculated

If a new visitor is identified by the stitching service (the hit is tied to a specific new person), then this metric increases.
