Install the Adobe Experience Cloud Debugger. The debugger inspects tags for the Analytics Cloud, Adobe Target, Advertising Cloud, Experience Cloud ID Service, Dynamic Tag Management, and Launch, by Adobe.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Adobe recommends using the [Adobe Experience Cloud Debugger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adobe-experience-cloud-de/ocdmogmohccmeicdhlhhgepeaijenapj) extension for Chrome.

When executed in your browser, it shows the image requests that transmitted data from that page into Experience Cloud solutions, along with any variable values or parameters that were captured. This allows you and your developers to check the validity of your implementation on any page on your site.

The DigitalPulse Debugger is officially supported for use in all recent versions and builds of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and Safari.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Because the Debugger functions by creating a pop-up window when you access a special bookmark in your web browser, certain ad-blocking plug-ins and pop-up blockers might interfere with the loading of the Debugger.
