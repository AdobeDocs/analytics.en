# Virtual report suite workflow

An overview of the steps required to plan an implement virtual report suites.

![](assets/step1_icon.png) Plan your virtual report suite strategy.

Familiarize yourself with [Global/Multi-Suite Tagging considerations](../../../components/vrs/vrs-considerations.md#concept_3DC65B7C9CA74C4AB291B7673E8B34B8) and the FAQs as you decide on your strategy.

![](assets/step2_icon.png) [Create a virtual report suite](../../../components/vrs/c-workflow-vrs/vrs-create.md#concept_442D6A63FE814CB6BA33016493AAB05A) by applying one or more segments to a parent report suite.

Virtual report suites are created in the Virtual Report Suite Manager ( Components > Virtual Report Suites).

Once created, a virtual report suite is treated just like a base report suite throughout the UI and is generally supported for most extended features. For example, virtual report suites show up in the Report Suite selectors and can be selected individually just like any other report suite.

Click the Info icon next to the report suite name to [view information about it](../../../components/vrs/c-workflow-vrs/vrs-view.md#concept_6B3069E5E3ED4F9FA33165FBEA6CA31A).

![](assets/step3_icon.png) Set up [Group permissions](../../../components/vrs/c-workflow-vrs/vrs-create.md#concept_442D6A63FE814CB6BA33016493AAB05A) for it.

You add group permissions as part of the creating a virtual report suite.

You can edit group permissions in two ways:

*   Edit the virtual report suite in the Virtual Report Suite Manager.
*   Go to Admin > User Management > Groups, then select the group that has permissions to the virtual report suite and click Edit.

![](assets/step4_icon.png) Open a project or report and select a virtual report suite to provide a segmented view of the data.

![](assets/step5_icon.png) [Manage](../../../components/vrs/c-workflow-vrs/vrs-manage.md#concept_8742A82D16014E5D9D361A4F045C49FE) the virtual report suite.

The Virtual Report Suite Manager lets you edit, add, tag, delete, rename, approve, copy, export, and filter virtual report suites. It is not visible to non-Admin users.
