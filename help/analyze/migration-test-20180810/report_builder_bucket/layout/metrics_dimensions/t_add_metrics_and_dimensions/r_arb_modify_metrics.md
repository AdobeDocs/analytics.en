# Modify metrics - field definitions


<table id="table_620F3BD3FD1B4C85A0319107EC03D54F"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Fields </th>

  </tr>

 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Subtotal (this request) </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>The subtotal of the response received from the server. Meaning, it provides the total number of items for line item metrics over a date range selected according to the elements you specify. When you click this option, data for all items with the specified starting rank and number of entries is totaled. </p> <p>This option is available only if you have selected a metric that you can aggregate. Subtotals presented still depend on any other criteria or filter you set in step 2 of the <span class="wintitle"> Request Wizard</span>. A suggested use of Subtotal (this request) is in combination with filtering. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p> Average </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Averages the item by day, week, or month. You can also specify none. </p> <p>For example, if you select the <span class="wintitle"> Paths</span> metric and map the names of the paths to the spreadsheet, you can choose to display the number of visits to the content path for a given time period as either the raw data (actual number of visits / time period), or as an average (number of visits / time period) per day, per week or per month. </p> </td>
