# Target Lift and Confidence

Lets you assess the success of campaigns in Adobe Analytics in the same way you have done in [!DNL Target Classic]  in the past.

 **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Reports]** > **[!UICONTROL View All Reports]** > **[!UICONTROL Adobe Target]** > **[!UICONTROL Analytics for Target]** > **[!UICONTROL Target Activities]** .

The Adobe Target documentation contains more information on [Lift](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/target/c_estimating_lift_in_revenue.html) and [Confidence](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/rec/c_Confidence_Level_and_Confidence_Interval.html).

To calculate Lift and Confidence:

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Target Activities]** report, click on an activity to bring up its details.
1. Under Report Type, select **[!UICONTROL Lift and Confidence]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Show Metrics]** to add one metric. You cannot add more than one metric for this type of report, since it is best practice to evaluate a test by only one metric. More metrics would only add noise and reduce the signal of the test.
1. (Optional) Under **[!UICONTROL Normalizing Metric]**, select one of the following: Visitors, Visits, or Impressions. Most of the time, this will be the default, Visitors.

1. The report will add these metrics, including the ratio between metric and normalizing metric.
