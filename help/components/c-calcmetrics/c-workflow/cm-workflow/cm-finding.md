# Find metrics

Describes the two main ways of finding your metrics: sorting and filtering.

## Sorting {#section_89F9C4D515084F5796F2A54D468BF6C8}

When you open a report and click the Metrics icon  ![](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Event_18_N.svg)) to the left of a report to bring up the Metrics rail, the **[!UICONTROL Sort By]** drop-down list in the Metrics Selector shows four sorting options:

|  Option  | When to use it  |
|---|---|
|  Alphabetical  | Useful if you know the name.  |
|  Recommended  | Common metrics that people use in the report - this is gathered by the back end from metrics users commonly use with this report.  |
|  Frequently Used  | Useful if you are a novice user and need to see what is commonly used on the report.  |
|  Recently Used  | Useful if you are working on a project and using the same set of metrics over and over.  |

## Filtering - Advanced Selection {#section_33818CC048C04F098703AC229693F8CA}

When you open a report and click the Metrics icon, then click **[!UICONTROL Manage]**. Now click the Filter icon. You can filter in a number of ways.
