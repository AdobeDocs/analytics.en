1. This integration may require downloading a few data point to your Selligent account. You may choose to give access for the same under **[!UICONTROL Access Request]**.
1. Under **[!UICONTROL Data Collection]**, choose an automated or manual solution (JavaScript Plug-in) to collect query string parameters from the landing page URL. If you choose an automated solution, enter your query string parameter for Message ID and Recipient ID which is MID and RID respectively. For JavaScript Plug-in, contact your Adobe Consultant.

1. Review the integration summary and click **[!UICONTROL Activate]**.

## Configuration within Selligent{#configuration-within-selligent}

As soon as the Integration is enabled inside Adobe Analytics, an automatic configuration is enabled on the Selligent side.

A tracker has been created which will track every e-mail. In case you want to limit it to a certain domain, please update the tracker configuration.

We highly recommended that you move the tracking parameter for Adobe Analytics in the URL to the front. This will ensure that the Adobe Processing rules pick up the parameters from the landing page URL. Enable the tracking by checking the checkbox as shown below.
