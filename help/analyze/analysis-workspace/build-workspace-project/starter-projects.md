# Templates...now called *Reports*

Templates is no longer used as a term for pre-built Workspace projects. Reports refers to anything that was pre-built by Adobe, such as reports in Reports & Analytics and pre-built reports in Workspace. However, the term *templates* is sometimes used to refer to templates or reports your company created. Custom templates are known as custom *company **report** templates*.

For information about creating Workspace reports and creating custom company reports, see the following documentation:

*  [Adobe Analytics landing page](/help/analyze/landing.md)
*  [Create a custom company report](/help/analyze/landing.md#company-report)
