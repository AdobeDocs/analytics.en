# Annotations overview

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is currently in limited testing.

Annotations enable you to effectively communicate contextual data nuances and insights to your organization. They let you tie calendar events to specific dimensions/metrics. You can annotate a date or date range for data issues, public holidays, campaign launches, etc. You can then graphically display events and see whether campaigns or other events have affected your site traffic, revenue, or any other metric. 

For example, let's say you are sharing projects you created with your organization. You notice a dip or a spike in traffic or other data, and you tie an annotation to the affected metrics, dimensions or segments. These annotations then show up in a table or a line visualization and provide data context for you and the consumers of your Workspace projects.

## Visibility

Annotations are visible in a variety of ways:

* Insert line viz image>

* Insert freeform table

* Insert PDF

## Turn annotations on or off

Annotations can be turned on or off in a few places:
