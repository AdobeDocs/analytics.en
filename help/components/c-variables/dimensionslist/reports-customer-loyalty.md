# Customer Loyalty

Customer Loyalty reveals purchasing patterns of customers.

The report displays purchasing patterns of customers based on four categories of loyalty:

* Not a Customer 
* New Customer 
* Return Customer 
* Loyal Customer

Although non-purchase metrics are viewable in this report (such as custom events, shopping cart events, and so on), the categories are always based on the number of orders placed. For example, a visitor might add a custom event named Internal Searches to the report. The [!UICONTROL Return Customer] line item would show the number of internal searches performed by visitors who have made two purchases previously, not the number of visitors who have made two internal searches.

**Customer Loyalty Processing**

The following tables define how Analysis Workspace, Reports & Analytics, Ad Hoc Analysis and Data Warehouse currently process Customer Loyalty:

|  version 14 Customer Loyalty (Current)  |
|---|
|  New Customer  | 1 visit and 1 purchase  |
|  Return Customer  | More than 1 visit and 2 purchases  |
|  Loyal Customer  | More than 1 visit and 3+ purchases  |

The loyalty state changes immediately following the purchase event within the same visit. For example, a New Customer (1 purchase) makes a purchase and then registers for a newsletter after that purchase within the same visit. The newsletter registration event is considered a Return Customer interaction, because the visitor's customer loyalty state changed immediately after the purchase occurred.
