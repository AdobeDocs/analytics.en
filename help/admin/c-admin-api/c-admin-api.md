# Adobe Analytics APIs

The following Adobe Analytics APIs are available on the Adobe Developer site: 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If you are creating a new integration, Adobe strongly recommends using the 2.0 API when possible.


* [**Adobe Analytics 2.0 API**](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/2.0/): The Adobe Analytics 2.0 API allows you to directly call Adobe's servers to perform the most common actions that you can perform in the user interface. 

* [**Adobe Anaytics 1.4 API**](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/1.4/): The Adobe Analytics 1.4 API is the predecessor to the Analytics 2.0 API. It contains some endpoints that are not yet available in the 2.0 API.
