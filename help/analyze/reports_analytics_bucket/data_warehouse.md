description: Data Warehouse refers to the copy of raw, unprocessed data for storage and custom reports, which you can run by filtering the data. You can request reports to display advanced data relationships from raw data based on your unique questions. Unlike most reports, which are displayed in the reporting interface, data warehouse reports are emailed or sent via FTP, and may take up to 72 hours to process. Processing time depends on the complexity of the query and the amount of data requested.
