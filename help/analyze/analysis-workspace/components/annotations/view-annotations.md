Annotations manifest slightly differently, depending on whether they span a single day or a date range.

## View annotations in Line charts or Tables

| Date | Appearance |
| --- | --- |
| **Single day** |   ![](assets/single-day.png)  |
| **Date range** |  The icon changes and when you hover over it, the date range appears.<p>![](assets/multi-day.png)<p>In a table, an icon appears on every date in the date range.<p>![](assets/multi-day-table.png)<p>Note the following: on days that have more than one annotation tied to them, the icon appears in a grey color.|

## View annotations in a Summary chart

## View annotations in a .pdf file

Since you cannot hover over icons in a .pdf file, this file (after export) provides notes of explanations at the bottom of a panel. Here is an example:

## View annotations that are not based on dates

Sometimes annotation are not tied to a date, but tied to a specific dimension. In that case, they appear only in a summary annotation in the bottom right corner. Here is an example:
