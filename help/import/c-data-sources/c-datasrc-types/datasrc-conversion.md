# Conversion

Data Sources supports the following conversion data dimensions and metrics for data types that are processed as conversion.

## Conversion Dimensions and Metrics {#section_FA1731B232B246DABEDF5A5D84159084}

If you specify a View event, you must also specify the corresponding data dimension (eVar). For example, if you include eVar2 views, then you must list eVar2 with a value. The number of custom events and eVar views supported by a report suite is contract-dependent, and varies between companies.
