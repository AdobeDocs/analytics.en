**Search Keywords - Paid**: Displays a breakdown of each paid search keyword that is used to find your site.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>For paid and natural search, search engines stopped providing (in most cases) the search keywords as part of the referrer. As a result, Adobe always classifies the Google (or Bing, or Yahoo) domain as search. Based on the format and contents of the referrer (even without the keywords), Adobe can determine often that it was the result of a search, so the search is counted with the Keywords Unavailable.
