# Customer attributes

For more detailed information on how to upload customer attributes, see the [ Experience Cloud help](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/attributes.html). 

* If it’s configured as a metric, VisAttr is exposed both as “dimension” and metric. ![](assets/ca_metrics.png) ![](assets/ca_dimension.png) 

* It supports the same breakdown as an eVar (anything can be broken down by anything).
* VisAttr supports all eVar metrics.
* VisAttr as a metric supports “bucketization” (like Time Spent on Site: 0 to 30, 31 to 60, …)
* VisAttr is available as a segmentation dimension.
