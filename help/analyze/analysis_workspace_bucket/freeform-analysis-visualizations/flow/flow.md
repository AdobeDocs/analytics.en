# Flow

The new flow feature shows customer paths through your websites and apps. 

With this new feature, you can: 


* Visualize the customer journey through your website or application
* Analyze where customers go before and after specified checkpoints, such as entry, a specific dimension, or exit
* Create segments by designating a specific point in a chosen path


>[!NOTE]
>
>For information on how the results of applying segments to Flow might differ between Analysis Workspace and Reports &amp; Analytics/Ad Hoc Analysis, see[ Segmentation as a Foundation for Flow &amp;amp; Fallout ](../../../analysis_workspace_bucket/freeform-analysis-visualizations/fallout_flow/fallout_flow.md#section_654F37A398C24DDDB1552A543EE29AA9). 


## Inter-Dimensional Flows {#section_7AA325E432C846B0AC51E70CCE79B4C0}

You can show the [ flow between dimensions ](../../../analysis_workspace_bucket/freeform-analysis-visualizations/flow/multi-dimensional-flow.md#concept_7D1D66E9D34D4C52902C8E2D92658B27). For example, you might combine pages and departments in one diagram. In this case, your flow might go from the home page, to the Men page, then to the Shoes department. 

Each column could show a different dimension. Drag a dimension and drop in a drop zone to add that dimension to the diagram. 

## Export Flow Diagrams as Part of Project .CSV Files {#section_BACD2639A0FC4C49A75398F7D0363D9D}

Flow diagrams are part of a project's .CSV file that you can create by going to  **[!UICONTROL  Project]** > **[!UICONTROL  Download CSV]** . This allows you to analyze Flow results within Microsoft Excel (visualized as a table) or elsewhere.
