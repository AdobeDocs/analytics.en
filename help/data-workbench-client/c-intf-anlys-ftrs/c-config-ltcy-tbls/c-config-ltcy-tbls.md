# Configure a latency table

A latency table is a table that includes a latency dimension, which is a type of derived dimension that measures the time that has elapsed since a particular event occurred.

 You define the event for measuring latency by making selections within one or more visualizations and setting those selections as the event using the [!UICONTROL Set Event menu] option within the latency table. For instructions to create and reuse latency tables, see [Latency Tables](../../../data-workbench-client/c-analysis-vis/c-lat-tbls.md#concept_7C7339E257FF4727AFDDA8E692BBBA44).

By default, latency tables provide information about the visitorsâ€™ sessions that occurred as many as seven days before or after the event. Using the instructions in the following sections, you can configure latency tables to provide information about different countable and time dimensions.
