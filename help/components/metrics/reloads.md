# Reloads

The 'Reloads' metric shows the number of times a dimension item was present during a reload. A visitor refreshing their browser is the most common way to trigger a reload.

## How this metric is calculated

This metric counts the number of hits where the [`Page`](../dimensions/page.md) dimension contains the same value as the previous hit.
