# Operating system

The 'Operating system' dimension shows the operating system and version that the visitor used. If you have features on your web-property that are OS-specific, this dimension helps you understand which operating systems are most common.

## Populate this dimension with data

This dimension references a lookup table internal to Adobe. The lookup value is based on the `User-Agent` HTTP header in image requests. If you use an AppMeasurement library (such as through Adobe Experience Platform Launch), this dimension works out of the box.

## Dimension values

Dimension values include operating systems that visitors use. Examples include `"Windows 10"`, `"OS X 10.15"`, and `"Android 9"`.
