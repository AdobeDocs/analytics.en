# Adobe Analytics Requirements{#adobe-analytics-requirements}

Review the following information about this data connectors integration as it relates to Adobe Analytics:

* **Report-Suite Specific:** Be advised that this integration is report-suite specific. Ensure that you have selected the desired report suite prior to activating the integration and that the report suite contains data. 
* **Available and configured Analytics variables:** This integration requires 10 custom events and 1 custom eVar. See [Analytics Integration Variables](../../appfigures-overview/appfigures-before-activation/appfigures-variables.md#concept-6c8a359719fd4794a42f5f6fb118f8b2). 

* **Report Suite initialized with Live data:** If you are creating a brand new report suite for this integration it needs to have received some (at least one hit) data via "live" tracking (instructions in [Adobe Analytics Requirements](../../appfigures-overview/appfigures-before-activation/appfigures-analytics-requirements.md#concept-3bf6a42b3b2f46cf84f929b91a1ad65c)). If "live" data has not been recorded, the report suite will not be ready to receive integrated App Store data. 

* **Existing integration with App store:** This integration back fills data for 13 months. In order to avoid any overlap with any previous App store data provider you might have had, please reach out to your appFigures representative. Let them know the last date you received data. appFigures will adjust the back fill period accordingly.
