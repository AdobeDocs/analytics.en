# Analytics Reports Using DFA Data{#analytics-reports-using-dfa-data}

Once DFA and Adobe® collection servers can communicate, you can generate reports in Reports & Analytics that include DFA data.

 Pre-packaged DFA reports include the following:

**Channel**: Displays data comparing Banner ads against other on-line ad options, such as Paid Search and Email.

**Delivery Tool**: Displays data comparing DoubleClick for Advertisers against other on-line ad services.

**Site Name**: Displays data comparing Web sites where DFA banner ads appeared.

**Page Name**: Displays data comparing individual Web pages where DFA banner ads appeared.

**Ad Name**: Displays data comparing specific DFA banner ads.

**Campaigns**: Displays data comparing different DFA ad campaigns

To generate a DFA report:

1. Log in to Adobe Experience Cloud.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics]**. Make sure you have selected the report suite where you installed the DFA integration.

1. In the left-side navigation, select the Conversion variable that captures the DFA click-through data, then select the desired DFA report.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Metrics]**. This opens the Metric Selector dialog box. 
1. Check the Impressions and Clicks metrics in the **[!UICONTROL Available Metrics]** list and click **[!UICONTROL Apply]**.

   The resulting report displays Impressions, Clicks, and Revenue data so you can see how your DFA services translate into bottom-line revenue.
   For example, a DFA Ad Name report displays the impressions, clicks, and revenue data directly attributable to specific banner ads in your current DFA ad campaign:

This report has the following important features:

* The report header, labeled DFA_Ad Name Report, displays the report time period (February 2009), and indicates that this is a Ranked report using a Horizontal Bar format.
* The Graph itself displays three metrics (Impressions, Clicks, and Revenue) for each DFA Ad in the report.
* The graph displays data for each metric as a percentage of the metric total, rather than using the actual numbers for each metric. You can change this in the **[!UICONTROL Configure Report]** dialog box.
* Below the graph, the DFA_Ad Name report lists the report details for each of the DFA Ads, and displays both numeric and percentage data for the Ad performance.
* Select a specific DFA Ad Name to open a menu of options for getting more information about that particular DFA ad.
* Each metric column includes a color key that corresponds to the metric’s assigned color in the graph.
* The report is ordered by the Revenue metric with highest revenue Ad at the top. You can change the report ordering clicking on a different column (metric) label.
