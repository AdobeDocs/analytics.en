## Known Conversion Issues {#section_39C922A58B2E49C9877B363042801361}

| Issue | Description |
|--- |--- |
|Minute granularity with breakdowns or in columns|When minute granularity has breakdowns applied to it or if minute granularity is present in columns, the project cannot be converted to Analysis Workspace.  A workaround is to remove the breakdown on minute granularity and remove it from columns, then convert the project. You can then apply breakdowns on minute granularity in Analysis Workspace.|
|Internal calculated metric used together with a column segment|If you are using an internal calculated metric together with a column segment, the project cannot be converted to Analysis Workspace. To work around this issue, remove the internal calculated metrics from the project before conversion, then re-add them in Analysis Workspace.|
