# Edit multiple requests

You can change several requests at the same time, based on the request's report suite, granularity, and date range.

You can change several requests at the same time, based on the request's report suite, segments, granularity, and date range. For example, you can update a report's parameters so that all requests are based on the same report suite or segment, or you can transform a daily report into a weekly or monthly report, provided that you retain the same number of periods. You can edit multiple requests for the current worksheet or all worksheets of a spreadsheet.

**To edit multiple requests** 

1. In Excel, click **[!UICONTROL Manage]**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >To edit requests contained in cells of individual worksheets, clear the [!UICONTROL All Sheets] option on the [!UICONTROL Request Manager]. By default, this box is checked if there are requests on several worksheets.

1. On the [!UICONTROL Request Manager] form, select two or more requests, then click **[!UICONTROL Edit Multiple]**.

   The [!UICONTROL Edit Multiple Requests] form displays columns of information: [!UICONTROL By Report Suite], [!UICONTROL By Segment], [!UICONTROL By Metric], [!UICONTROL By Date Range and Granularity], and [!UICONTROL By Group].
1. To group the display of requests, click any of the following options:

    * **By Report Suite:** Groups the display of requests by report suite.
    * **By Segment**: Groups the requests based on the segment name.

        * **Choose Segment**: Displays if no segments exist for the requests. To add segments, click **[!UICONTROL Edit Group]** and select a segment from the [!UICONTROL Edit Group] panel.

    * **By Metric:** See [Edit Metrics Across Multiple Requests](/help/analyze/report-builder/manage-requests/edit-multiple-metrics.md).
    
    * **By Date Range and Granularity:** Groups the display of requests by date range and time granularity.
    * **By Group:** Groups the display of requests by set of grouped requests.

1. On the [!UICONTROL Edit Multiple Requests] form, click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.
