Note: The search data is pulled from the search engines around 6AM (06:00) in the time zone of your Adobe Analytics data center. This is when the AMO data is collected and inserted into the report suite. It is then converted into the report suite time zone as part of inserting the data into Analytics.

Reporting is available in

*   Analysis Workspace "Paid Search Performance" template
*   Reports & Analytics
*   Report Builder
*   Analytics Reporting API
