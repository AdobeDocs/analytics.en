# Create and manage company templates

You can create custom reports and save them for others in your login company to use. Company templates are available to choose when creating a project, as described in [Create a project from a blank project or a report](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/create-projects.md#create-a-project-from-a-blank-project-or-a-report) in the article, [Create projects in Analysis Workspace](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/create-projects.md).

## Create a custom company template

To create a new company template:

1. Build a project in Analysis Workspace to your desired state.
1. Select [!UICONTROL **Project**] > **[!UICONTROL Save as company template...]**.
   
   ![Company report](assets/company-report.png)

1. Update the name of the report, add a description, and add any tags, then select [!UICONTROL **Save as company template**]. 

   The template is added to the Company templates list in the Create Project modal and is available to users in your login company. 

   For more information about how users can create a project based on a company template, see "Create a project from a blank project or a report" in [Create projects](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/create-projects.md).

## Manage company templates

Admins can filter the project list to display and manage company templates. Pinned items remain pinned followed by the list of company templates that are identified by the report icon ![report icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_FileTemplate_18_N.svg). In this view, you can delete, rename, tag, or approve one or more reports.

To display and manage company templates:

1. In the filter rail, select **OTHER FILTERS** and then select **Company templates**. 

   A list of the company templates are displayed. All regular projects, unless they're pinned, are not displayed.
