# Segment comparison features

Analysts can spend many hours or even days searching for relevant differences between segments across an organization's metrics and dimensions. This analysis is tedious and time consuming. And you might miss a segment's key difference that could make a significant impact to your targeted marketing efforts.

The [Segment comparison use cases](c-panels/c-segment-comparison/segment-compare-use-cases.md) for real-world scenarios assist organizations with gaining valuable insights on segments and how they compare. 

The segment comparison features are:

* [Segment comparison panel:](c-panels/c-segment-comparison/segment-comparison.md) The core feature in Segment IQ. Drag two segments into the panel, and view a comprehensive report that shows statistically significant differences and overlap between the two audiences.
* [Comparing segments in fallout:](visualizations/fallout/compare-segments-fallout.md) See how different audiences compare to each other in the context of a fallout visualization.
