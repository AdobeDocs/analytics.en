Cumulative release notes for [!DNL AppMeasurement] for JavaScript.

<!-- 

<p>https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/omtrcache/AppMeasurement+Change+Log </p>

 -->

The latest version of each library can be downloaded in **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Code Manager]**.

## Versions 2.17.0

Release date: **August 23, 2019**

| Feature/Fix    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
| Added Baidu support| Added support for Baidu query string reordering.|
| Fix | Fixed an issue that caused stale visitor values in hits that were queued while waiting for opt-in.|

## Version 2.16.0

Release Date: **August 15, 2019**

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
| `sendBeacon` support for exit links  | Implemented `sendBeacon` support in [!UICONTROL AppMeasurement] for exit links. This will improve exit link tracking and will likely result in increased traffic. `SendBeacon` doesn't execute in the context of a page but in the context of the browser. That is if a page unloads with `sendBeacon`, the request will still be completed. This is very useful for exit links because it will make it much more likely that the exit link request will be completed.|  
| ECID/fid values | ECID/fid values are now cached on the first hit even though OptIn settings change. |
| DIL 9.3  | Updated  Audience Management Module to DIL 9.3 |
| Scroll reach tracking  | Exposed switch in s.ActivityMap.trackScrollReach to turn scroll reach tracking on or off. |
| Visitor ID Service 4.4.0 | Upgraded AppMeasurement to use Visitor ID Service 4.4.0. |

Release date: **03/09/2017**

* Moved to a new build process that requires a version number update to 2.0.0. (AN-137878) 
* Moved mboxMCSDID handling into the correct section location where the tracking call is made. (AN-138483)

## Version 1.8.0 {#section_617B2F09F3494C04901E364ACEDE17E1}

Release date: **01/19/2017**

* Include VisitorAPI 2.0.0 
* Re-sequenced function calls and checks so that the SDID is consumed after the abort check has completed. (AN-134364) 
* Added the following pre- and post-tracking call hooks. (AN-134567)

    * s.registerPreTrackCallback 
    * s.registerPostTrackCallback

  These functions take as parameters: the callback (a function), and the parameters to that function. For example:

  ```
  s.registerPreTrackCallback(function(requestUrl,a,b,c) { 
      console.log("pre track callback"); 
      console.dir(requestUrl); // Request URL 
      console.dir(a); // param1 
      console.dir(b); // param2 
      console.dir(c); // param3 
  }, "param1", "param2", "param3");
  ```

  The callback is invoked with the `requestUrl` and any parameters passed in when the callback is registered. This occurs either before or after the tracking call, depending on which method is used to register the callback. The order in which these callbacks are called is not guaranteed. Callbacks registered in the pre function are invoked after the final tracking URL is created. The post callbacks are called upon a successful tracking call (if the tracking call fails, these functions are not called). Any callback registered with `registerPreTrackCallback` do not affect the tracking call. Also, calling any of the tracking methods in any registered callback is not recommended and could cause an infinite loop.

* Inclusion of Visitor API 1.4.
* Updated AudienceManagement module to use DIL version 6.0.

**Known Issue**

In the Visitor API / [!DNL AppMeasurement] [!DNL Audience Manager] Module integrations, there will be two destination publishing iFrame requests made in IE6-9: `//fast.<subdomain>.demdex.net/dest5.html` and  `//fast.<subdomain>.demdex.net/dest4.html`. The correct behavior, as seen in other browsers, is to only load `//fast.<subdomain>.demdex.net/dest5.html`.

A minor fix to clear the light-server call profile ID after the `trackLight` call.

## Version 1.4.3 {#section_C307052BA42248ADB1969AE7A2593177}

Release Date: **February 19, 2015**

* Made all handling of delayed tracking calls consistent, which fixes issues with backed-up variables during the delay, such as the clicked object.
* Changed to not do automatic referrer tracking after the first tracking call so the 2nd, 3rd, etc tracking call (usually link tracking) will not double-count the referrer when *`s.referrer`* was manually set before the first tracking call.
* The distribution zip was updated to include Visitor API 1.3.5.

## Version 1.4.2 {#section_0A0BE40D32144A338231022F97B0E72B}

Release Date: **January 15, 2015**

* Fixed handling of WebKit prerender handling to prevent tracking of pre-rendered pages that are not viewed.
* The distribution zip was updated to include Visitor API 1.3.4 and an updated **[!UICONTROL AudienceManagement]** module that includes DIL version 5.5.

## Version 1.4.1 {#section_616FF936062F44E8B70032D18AAAFC5F}

Release Date: **September 18, 2014**

* Added a `tagContainerMarker` variable that allows the implementation to specify up to 4 characters that are appended to the version string along with an additional dash character delimiter. This is used by dynamic tag management.

  ```js
  // JavaScript 
  s.tagContainerMarker = "D1.0"; 
    
  // Data Collection request 
  //.../b/ss/myrsid/1/JS-1.4.1-D1.0/s43317392037311?...
  ```

  The 4 characters are limited to characters that are allowed in URL file paths, such as alpha-numeric and period.

* On pages that are dual-tagged with H Code, fixed a loop that might occur during automatic link tracking (download and exit) with when forced link tracking is enabled (default in Webkit browsers). Additionally, added a general safeguard around automatic link tracking to prevent similar loops. This safeguard limits automatic link tracking of repeated clicks to the *same* object to once every 10 seconds. This safeguard applies only to automatic link tracking, so manual link tracking (s.tl) calls are not limited. Clicks to different objects are also not impacted by this safeguard and will be tracked.
* Fixed handling of clicked object when a delay is needed.
* Fixed an issue that caused a double page-view count when s.t was called from a link onclick function, if the Visitor API does not have the needed values yet.
* HTTP POST support.

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  >For an [!DNL Analytics] call to use the POST method instead of the GET method in [!DNL AppMeasurement] (a method of solving [truncated URLs in IE](https://helpx.adobe.com/analytics/kb/shortening-image-request-urls.html)), you must be using the latest [Visitor ID Service](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/mcvid_implement.html) implementation for Experience Cloud.

## Version 1.4 {#section_56ADFF9416B14ABCB3862B00F72B30A1}

Release Date: **August 21, 2014**

* Removed tracking of browser plug-ins ( `p` query parameter) as plug-ins are no longer reported in version 15.

Added support for [additional eVars](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/implement/evars_events.html) (76 - 250) and events (101-1000).

> [!NOTE] H-Code does not support the additional eVars and events.

[!DNL JavaScript]  

## Version 1.3.2 {#section_402A4142C4B846DE945FD59DAD9D9298}

Release Date: **June 19, 2014**

* Fixed handling of done and waiting flags for Visitor API fields such as the legacy [!DNL Analytics] Visitor ID, that was causing errors.

## Version 1.3.1 {#section_5E65422B9C1E4437A2473B119A14163E}

Release Date: **May 22, 2014**

* [!DNL AppMeasurement] for [!DNL JavaScript] `s_gi` function was not correctly finding instances created using H code `s_gi`. Note that this issue only impacted some dual tagging implementations where [!DNL AppMeasurement] for [!DNL JavaScript] and H code were on the same page with separate instances, and `s_gi` was being used to find instances by report suite.

## Version 1.3 {#section_56B2C625368E4A5BA1E8770A8C78117D}

Release Date: **April 17, 2014**

## Version 1.1.1 {#section_31F06384039648BB99F4BD630B685794}

* Prevented a link tracking call from being sent from Opera browsers for links that start with "opera:" ("opera:" is similar to "about:" and "chrome:" in other browsers).
* Added `alt=""` to all Image objects to comply with Accessible Video and Communications Act.

## Version 1.1 {#section_4508FF0A14AE46DF96A08B5C6703E123}

Release Date: **September 18, 2013**

* Fixed support for placing the library and page code in the `head` tag.
* Added missing module `onLoad` support.

## Version 1.0.3 {#section_A74A78C30067480AB36C54A06706DF89}

Release Date: **August 15, 2013**

* Added support for deployment through Adobe tag management.
* Fixed an issue that prevented hierarchy variables from being set on the [!DNL AppMeasurement] object.

## Version 1.0.2 {#section_C3BDD9A19EF84467A8FDC283AEAE2DB5}

Release Date: **July 18, 2013**

* The hash/fragment is now ignored by automatic link tracking. Previously the following URL was automatically tracked since the entire `href` ended in `.pdf`:

  ```js
  <a href="index.htm#anchor.pdf">Test Link</a>
  ```

  Now the hash/fragment is ignored so the link is tracked only when the filename ends in an extension that matches.

## Version 1.0.1 {#section_3758B0C47171436ABB4B29F5924BE893}

Release Date: **May 23, 2013**

A new [!DNL JavaScript] [!DNL AppMeasurement] library is now available in Code Manager. This library provides the same core functionality of [!DNL s_code.js], but is lighter and faster for use on both mobile and desktop sites.

* 3-7x faster than the H.25 code.
* Only 21k uncompressed and 8k gzipped (H.25 code is 33k uncompressed and 13k gzipped).
* Native support to get query parameters, read and write cookies, and perform advanced link tracking.
* Small and fast enough to be used with mobile sites, and robust enough to be used on the full desktop web, allowing you to leverage a single library across all web environments.

See [AppMeasurement for Javascript](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/implement/appmeasure_mjs.html) in the [!DNL Analytics] Implementation Guide.

> [!NOTE] Some plug-ins are not supported in this new version. See [Plug-in Support](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/implement/plugins_support.html) for details.
