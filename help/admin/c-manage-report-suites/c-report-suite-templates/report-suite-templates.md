# Report suite templates overview

Report suite templates configure the most common settings for several types of report suites.

To save time when creating a new report suite, you can select a template that is similar the report suite configuration you have designed. Selecting a report suite template does not limit your implementation in any way. Any configuration made by a report suite template can be changed after the report suite is created.
