Use Dynamic Tag Management to manage tags and collect and distribute data across digital marketing systems. Dynamic Tag Management provides a single data layer that pushes data from multiple sources. Dynamic Tag Management also enables responsive delivery of user-specific content.

This help section provides specific information about using Dynamic Tag Management to implement Adobe Analytics. For detailed information about Dynamic Tag Management, refer to the [Dynamic Tag Management Product Documentation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/dtm/using/dtm-home.html).
