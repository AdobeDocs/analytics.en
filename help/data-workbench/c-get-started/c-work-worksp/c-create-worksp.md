# Create a workspace

You can customize existing workspaces by adding or modifying existing visualizations or creating new workspaces.

You can then save these workspaces for later use. See [Creating Workspaces](../../c-get-started/c-work-worksp/c-create-worksp.md#concept_D8BC99D7739E4EAEAB2A02B022394A31).

You can create new workspaces by creating a blank workspace, copying and pasting an existing workspace, or saving a workspace to another location or using another name.

This section describes the following tasks:

* [Adding New Workspaces](../../c-get-started/c-work-worksp/c-create-worksp.md#section_4236AE30E2884EA08F0885BF329F0778) 
* [Copying and Pasting Existing Workspaces](../../c-get-started/c-work-worksp/c-create-worksp.md#section_F91AE89B845640C9A4A52820A6110E65) 
* [Changing a Workspace Name](../../c-get-started/c-work-worksp/c-create-worksp.md#section_CA7EDB913E4E4630A856F45A2536FFAD)

## Adding New Workspaces {#section_4236AE30E2884EA08F0885BF329F0778}

On the desired [!UICONTROL Worktop] tab, right-click a blank area within the tab and click one of the following options:

* **[!UICONTROL New]** > **[!UICONTROL Blank Workspace]**. This option displays a standard size, blank workspace. 

* **[!UICONTROL New]** > **[!UICONTROL Report Template]**. This option displays a standard size template that you can use to create reports.

## Copying and Pasting Existing Workspaces {#section_F91AE89B845640C9A4A52820A6110E65}

You can copy and paste an existing workspace onto to any other workspace. If you paste the workspace on a tab that contains a server version of a workspace with the same name, the workspace is pasted as a local version of that workspace. If you paste the workspace on a tab that contains server and local versions of a workspace with the same name, the workspace is pasted as a user version of that workspace with the same name followed by (Copy). If you paste the workspace on a tab that does not contain a workspace with the same name, the workspace is pasted as a new user workspace.

**To copy and paste an existing workspace**

1. On the desired [!UICONTROL Worktop] tab, right-click the workspace that you want to copy and click **[!UICONTROL Copy]**.

   The following example is a workspace pasted on a workspace tab that contains a server version:

The following example is a workspace pasted on a workspace tab that already contains a server and local version. The workspace is pasted as a user version of that workspace with the same name followed by (Copy):
