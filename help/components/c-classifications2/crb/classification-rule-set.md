# Classification rule sets

A rule set is a group of classification rules for a specific variable. You apply a variable to the rule set. If you want to create multiple rule sets for one variable, you must apply each rule set to multiple report suites.

## Create a Classification Rule Set {#create-classification-rule-set}

<!-- 

t_classification_rule_set.xml

 -->

Name the classification rule set, apply the variable, and specify overwrite settings.

1. (Prerequisite) Define the classification structure in **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Report Suites]**.

   (See [Classifications](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/classifications.html) in Admin Tools help on adding classifications.)

   Variables will display in the [!UICONTROL New Rule Set] panel only after they have at least one classification defined for that variable.

   You can create classifications on a variable in **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Report Suites]** > **[!UICONTROL Traffic]** > **[!UICONTROL Traffic Classifications]** (or **[!UICONTROL Conversion]** > **[!UICONTROL Conversion Classifications]**). Then select the variable, then click **[!UICONTROL Add Classification]**.

1. To create the rule set, click **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Classification Rule Builder]** > **[!UICONTROL Add Rule Set]**.

   The report suite and variable list is populated with all classified variables available in all the report suites in your log-in company. A single variable in a report suite can belong to only one rule set.

   See *`Variable`* in the definitions for the [Classification Rule Builder](/help/components/c-classifications2/crb/classification-rule-definitions.md) page for more information.
1. Specify the report suites and variables to use, then click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
1. Continue by [adding classification rules](/help/components/c-classifications2/crb/classification-rule-set.md) to the rule set.
