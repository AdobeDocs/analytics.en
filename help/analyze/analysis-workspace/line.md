# Line

This visualization represents metrics using a line in order to show how values change over a period of time. A line chart can be used only when time is used as a dimension.

A granularity drop-down in the [visualization settings](../../../analyze/analysis-workspace//freeform-analysis-visualizations.md#section_D3BB5042A92245D8BF6BCF072C66624B) lets you change a trended visualization (e.g. line, bar) from daily to weekly to monthly, etc.
