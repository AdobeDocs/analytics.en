# Report Schedule and Distribution

## Report Schedule and Distribution {#concept_4EA333DFC7FD4E9CA086385A3DA10BE9}
>Information about scheduling, downloading and distributing reports.When you schedule a report for delivery in an Adobe Analytics application, you can use the Scheduling and Distribution tools to view what files have been automatically sent and modify or terminate the deliveries. 

Due to differences in processing mechanisms and platforms, the various types of downloadable and scheduled reports available in Adobe Analytics have different limitations regarding the maximum number of rows they can process in a single request. Here are the limits of each: 

* Word, CSV, Excel, HTML and PDF: The same number of rows visible in the report. By default this limit is 50 rows but can increase up to 200. Breakdown reports have a hard limit of 50 rows.
* Data Extracts: 50,000 rows
* Data Warehouse: Unlimited
Note that these limitations are for individual scheduled and downloaded reports; dashboards are limited to the amount of space available within a reportlet.

>## Manage scheduled reports {#task_C17677C543454FF2B06D10EA5652DFBC}
>Information about managing scheduled reports.
<!-- t_schedule_manage.xml -->
In the [!UICONTROL  Schedule Reports Manager], you can edit and delete recurring report deliveries. You can create delivery schedules that send your reports via email or FTP to a specified address. You can configure these schedules to automatically send the reports at specified intervals for a duration of time or indefinitely, or stop the delivery of a recurring report. 

The [!UICONTROL  Schedule Report Manager] shows the items that a specific user has created. If the user account is disabled in the application, all scheduled deliveries stop. 

>1. To access the manager, click **[!UICONTROL  Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL  Components]** > **[!UICONTROL  Scheduled Reports]**.
>## Share a report link {#task_9711DDE9E140451B8C914EC5513E21EC}
>Steps that describe how to share a report by generating a report link (URL) to send to another user.
<!-- t_reports_share_link.xml -->
When the recipient clicks the link, the system requests login credentials (company name, user name, and password). After logging in, the recipient is shown the report generated by the original user. Standard permission restrictions apply. 

**To share a report link** 

>1. Run a report.
>1. Click **[!UICONTROL  More]** > **[!UICONTROL  Link to This Report]**.
>## Unsubscribe from scheduled reports {#concept_6B48360F935740B6851BA85D32DEF637}
>You can unsubscribe from scheduled reports. You will no longer receive the report even if your user name is re-added to the scheduled report.
<!-- t_schedule_unsubscribe.xml -->

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>In order for you to again receive the report, a new schedule needs to be created.

To unsubscribe from a scheduled report: 

1. Bring up the email with the link to the report from which you want to unsubscribe. ![](assets/unsubscribe-email.png) 

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL  click here]** link next to **[!UICONTROL  To cancel automatic delivery of this report]**.
1. Confirm that you want to cancel the report delivery. 
   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >This workflow is the same whether you are the report scheduler or the report recipient.

Unsubscribing from a report does not cancel the scheduled report. 

To cancel a scheduled report, navigate to the Schedule Manager and click on the red X next to the report name. [ More... ](../reports_analytics_bucket/scheduling.md#task_C17677C543454FF2B06D10EA5652DFBC)
