# Add dependent requests

A dependent request is a request that is dependent upon an existing request.

For reports with correlation breakdowns enabled within the report table, to take a closer look at an item,  right-click in the cell and then click **[!UICONTROL Add Dependent Request]** > **[!UICONTROL Breakdown]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can also add a breakdown request when you create the original request. See [Create a Data Request](/help/analyze/legacy-report-builder/data-requests/t-create-a-data-request.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Report Builder enforces request dependencies only within the same worksheet, not across worksheets. Restricting to dependencies within a single worksheet ensures timeliness of execution.
