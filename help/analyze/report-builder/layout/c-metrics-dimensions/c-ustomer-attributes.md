# Customer attributes

Customer attributes are stored in new type of element called VisAttr, which can be configured as a dimension or a metric.

 For more detailed information on how to upload customer attributes, see the [Experience Cloud help](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/attributes.html).

* If it’s configured as a metric, VisAttr is exposed both as “dimension” and metric.

* It supports the same breakdown as an eVar (anything can be broken down by anything). 
* VisAttr supports all eVar metrics. 
* VisAttr as a metric supports “bucketization” (like Time Spent on Site: 0 to 30, 31 to 60, …) 
* VisAttr is available as a segmentation dimension.
