## Manage alerts

You can manage existing alerts in the Alerts manager. You can perform various management tasks on alerts, such as tagging, renaming, deleting, and more.

The Alerts manager is structured very much like the [Segment Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-manage.html) and the [Calculated Metric Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/calculated-metrics/calcmetric-workflow/cm-manager.html).

## Create alerts

To create alerts from the Alerts manager:

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Components]** > **[!UICONTROL Alerts]** to access the Alerts manager in Adobe Analytics.
