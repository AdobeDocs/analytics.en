# SFTP services upgrade - FAQ

In September 20, 2022, Adobe Analytics will upgrade its Secure File Transfer Protocol [SFTP] services in order to provide improved security for file transfers. With this change, some SFTP client configurations will no longer be supported. This only impacts data sent to or retrieved from Adobe Analytics using SFTP. The FTP protocol will not be impacted. In order to avoid service disruptions, please ensure your SFTP clients (code, tools, services) will be in accordance with the changes detailed below.

## How can I determine which algorithms, connection types, and protocols are currently used by my organization?

The FTP/SFTP software you are using should indicate what specific settings are being used in the connections you have configured for exchanging data with Adobe Analytics. This software should also include documentation about the different options available for connections. The options that will be supported after this update are widely supported and accepted in the industry.

The connection options that will be removed are generally considered obsolete and not used in current software. If you upgraded your FTP/SFTP software within the last three years, you likely already have a compliant connection.

## Which Adobe Analytics features use SFTP for data ingestion?
