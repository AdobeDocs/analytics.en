View and segment your Adobe Target traffic data in a report.

## Target {#topic_EBC899DB84A84780A1B8EE95C6C4CF18}

View and segment your Adobe Target traffic data in a report.

Examples include:

* Measuring the success of Adobe [!DNL Target] campaigns through your KPIs.
* Breaking down [!DNL Target] campaign and recipe data with conversion variables.
* Breaking down other reports with [!DNL Target] campaign and recipe traffic data.

By leveraging data in Analytics reports, you can drill into your [!DNL Target] recipes using [breakdowns](/help/analyze/reports-analytics/reports-customize/breakdowns.md) and detect high performing segments that are ideal for future tests and potentially targeted campaigns. The report displays Analytics conversion data rather than conversion data from [!DNL Target].

See the [Target](https://help.testandtarget.omniture.com/) help system for more information.
