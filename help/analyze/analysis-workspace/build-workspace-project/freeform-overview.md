# Create project - overview

 **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Workspace]**

You can create a robust Analytics project based on any combination of visualizations, report components, and data tables. It brings many of the table builder features from Ad Hoc Analysis into Analytics.

In Analysis Workspace, you can compare and dissect data in ways not previously possible. For example, configure ranked reports and make immediate iterative changes to the data query, and then access and manipulate the values at the reporting level.

The query goes directly to the reporting engineâ€”you can make changes inline without bringing up other reports to create your analysis. Results return immediately, with no browser refresh.

## Workspace Project List Page {#section_39AA007D7C384F4E869F842F1C7B11F8}

When you first go to **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Workspace]**, the page lists all the projects you own or have been granted access to. You can set this page to be your Adobe Analytics landing page by clicking **[!UICONTROL Set as Landing Page]**. (If you don't see this option, as in the screen shot below, it is already your landing page.)

The Workspace project list page contains the following information: 

|  Element  | Description  |
|---|---|
| Project [Templates](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/starter-projects.md)  | You can use these pre-populated project templates as they are or adapt them to your needs (by adding or replacing metrics or visualizations, for example) and save them under a new name.  |
| [Create New Project](/help/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/t-freeform-project.md)  | Click this link to start a new project from scratch.  |
|  Manage Projects  |Clicking this link takes you to the Projects Component Manager ( **[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Components]** > **[!UICONTROL Projects]**), which lists all your projects and lets you tag, share, delete, rename, approve, copy, and export projects to CSV.  |
|  View Tutorials  |Takes you to the [Analysis Workspace YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2tCx83mn7GuNnQdYGOtlyCu0V5mEZ8sS).  |
