* Fixed a security-related issue by updating Internet Explorer detection to suppress JSLint warning.

## Version 2.19.0

Release Date: **February 21, 2020**

* Updated Audience Management module to DIL 9.4. (AN-209341)

## Version 2.18.0

Release Date: **February 13, 2020**

* AppMeasurement can now force cookies to include the Secure attribute by setting the [`writeSecureCookies`](vars/config-vars/writesecurecookies.md) variable. The requirement for this variable is that the entire client website is served securely (HTTPS). (AN-204604)

## Version 2.17.0

Release date: **August 23, 2019**

* Added support for Baidu query string reordering. (AN-182483)

## Version 2.16.0

Release Date: **August 15, 2019**

* Implemented `sendBeacon` support in [!UICONTROL AppMeasurement] for exit links. If a hit uses `sendBeacon` and the page unloads, the request is still completed. This is very useful for exit links because it is more likely that the hit reaches data collection servers. (AN-175142)
* ECID/fid values are now cached on the first hit even though OptIn settings change. (AN-175142)
* Updated  Audience Management Module to DIL 9.3. (AN-182704)

* Support for Visitor API 1.5, which uses the *`getCustomerIDs`* method to gather Customer IDs and authenticated state, and sends the IDs in with data collection requests.
* Fixed the creation of duplicate destinationing iframe in **[!UICONTROL AudienceManagement]** module (DIL 6.1)
* Fixed the known issue described in release 1.4.5.

## Version 1.4.5

Release Date: **May 21, 2015**

* Starting in iOS SDK version 4.5, a new iOS extension lets you collect usage data from your Apple Watch apps, Today widgets, Photo Editing widgets, and all other iOS extension apps. See [iOS extension implementation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/mobile-services/ios/ios-ext/ios-ext.html) in the Mobile services user guide.
* Starting in Android SDK version 4.5, a new Android extension lets you collect data from your Android wearable app. See [Android wearables](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/mobile-services/android/wearables-android/android-wearable.html) in the Mobile services user guide.
* Inclusion of Visitor API 1.4.
* Updated AudienceManagement module to use DIL version 6.0.

> [!NOTE] **Known Issue**: In the Visitor API / [!DNL AppMeasurement] [!DNL Audience Manager] Module integrations, there are two destination publishing iFrame requests made in IE6-9: `//fast.<subdomain>.demdex.net/dest5.html` and  `//fast.<subdomain>.demdex.net/dest4.html`. The correct behavior, as seen in other browsers, is to only load `//fast.<subdomain>.demdex.net/dest5.html`.

## Version 1.4.4

Release Date: **April 16, 2015**

* You can now include custom context data variables with lifecycle metrics.
* The `trackBeacon` and `clearCurrentBeacon` calls are now available in PhoneGap.
* A minor fix to clear the light server call profile ID after the `trackLight` call.

## Version 1.4.3

Release Date: **February 19, 2015**

* Made all handling of delayed tracking calls consistent, which fixes issues with backed-up variables during the delay, such as the clicked object.
* Changed to not do automatic referrer tracking after the first tracking call so the 2nd, 3rd, etc tracking call (usually link tracking) will not double-count the referrer when *`s.referrer`* was manually set before the first tracking call.
* The distribution zip was updated to include Visitor API 1.3.5.

## Version 1.4.2

Release Date: **January 15, 2015**

* Fixed handling of WebKit prerender handling to prevent tracking of pre-rendered pages that are not viewed.
* The distribution zip was updated to include Visitor API 1.3.4 and an updated **[!UICONTROL AudienceManagement]** module that includes DIL version 5.5.

## Version 1.4.1

Release Date: **September 18, 2014**

* Added a `tagContainerMarker` variable that allows the implementation to specify up to 4 characters that are appended to the version string along with an additional dash character delimiter. This is used by dynamic tag management.

  ```js
  // JavaScript
  s.tagContainerMarker = "D1.0";

  // Data Collection request
  //.../b/ss/myrsid/1/JS-1.4.1-D1.0/s43317392037311?...
  ```

  The 4 characters are limited to characters that are allowed in URL file paths, such as alpha-numeric and period.

* On pages that are dual-tagged with H Code, fixed a loop that might occur during automatic link tracking (download and exit) with when forced link tracking is enabled (default in Webkit browsers). Additionally, added a general safeguard around automatic link tracking to prevent similar loops. This safeguard limits automatic link tracking of repeated clicks to the *same* object to once every 10 seconds. This safeguard applies only to automatic link tracking, so manual link tracking (s.tl) calls are not limited. Clicks to different objects are also not impacted by this safeguard and will be tracked.
* Fixed handling of clicked object when a delay is needed.
* Fixed an issue that caused a double page-view count when s.t was called from a link onclick function, if the Visitor API does not have the needed values yet.
* HTTP POST support.

  > [!IMPORTANT] For an [!DNL Analytics] call to use the POST method instead of the GET method in [!DNL AppMeasurement] (a method of solving [truncated URLs in IE](https://helpx.adobe.com/analytics/kb/shortening-image-request-urls.html)), you must be using the latest Visitor ID Service implementation for the Experience Cloud.

## Version 1.4

Release Date: **August 21, 2014**

* Removed tracking of browser plug-ins (`p` query parameter) as plug-ins are no longer reported in version 15.
* Addition of the **[!UICONTROL AudienceManagement]** Module in the download zip.
* Added support for additional eVars (76 - 250) and events (101-1000).

> [!NOTE] H-Code does not support the additional eVars and events.

## Version 1.3.2

Release Date: **June 19, 2014**

* Fixed handling of done and waiting flags for Visitor API fields such as the legacy [!DNL Analytics] Visitor ID, that was causing errors.
* Support for new features in visitor ID service 1.3.

## Version 1.3.1

Release Date: **May 22, 2014**

* [!DNL AppMeasurement] for [!DNL JavaScript] `s_gi` function was not correctly finding instances created using H code `s_gi`. Note that this issue only impacted some dual tagging implementations where [!DNL AppMeasurement] for [!DNL JavaScript] and H code were on the same page with separate instances, and `s_gi` was being used to find instances by report suite.

## Version 1.3

Release Date: **April 17, 2014**

* Support for the [Experience Cloud Visitor ID service](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/id-service/using/home.html).

## Version 1.2.4

Release Date: **March 13, 2014**

* Bug fixes for heartbeat video.

## Version 1.2.3

Release Date: **February 20, 2014**

* Bug fixes for heartbeat video.

## Version 1.2.2

Release Date: **February 6, 2014**

* Fixed a compatibility issue with the [!DNL Audience Manager] DIL module. [!DNL Audience Manager] customers must also update to version 4.8 of the DIL module.

## Version 1.2.1

Release Date: **November 15, 2013**

* Fixed page events that are used for Heartbeat video measurement.

## Version 1.2

Release Date: **November 14, 2013**

* Added support for [Heartbeat video measurement](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/media-analytics/using/media-overview.html).
* `VisitorAPI.js` was added to support [Visitor ID Service](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/id-service/using/home.html).

## Version 1.1.1

* Prevented a link tracking call from being sent from Opera browsers for links that start with "opera:" ("opera:" is similar to "about:" and "chrome:" in other browsers).
* Added `alt=""` to all Image objects to comply with Accessible Video and Communications Act.

## Version 1.1

Release Date: **September 18, 2013**

* Fixed support for placing the library and page code in the `head` tag.
* Added missing module `onLoad` support.

## Version 1.0.3

Release Date: **August 15, 2013**

* Added support for deployment through Adobe tag management.
* Fixed an issue that prevented hierarchy variables from being set on the [!DNL AppMeasurement] object.

## Version 1.0.2

Release Date: **July 18, 2013**

* The hash/fragment is now ignored by automatic link tracking. Previously the following URL was automatically tracked since the entire `href` ended in `.pdf`:

  ```js
  <a href="index.htm#anchor.pdf">Test Link</a>
  ```

  Now the hash/fragment is ignored so the link is tracked only when the filename ends in an extension that matches.

## Version 1.0.1

Release Date: **May 23, 2013**

A new [!DNL JavaScript] [!DNL AppMeasurement] library is now available in Code Manager. This library provides the same core functionality of [!DNL s_code.js], but is lighter and faster for use on both mobile and desktop sites.

* 3-7x faster than the H.25 code.
* Only 21k uncompressed and 8k gzipped (H.25 code is 33k uncompressed and 13k gzipped).
* Native support to get query parameters, read and write cookies, and perform advanced link tracking.
* Small and fast enough to be used with mobile sites, and robust enough to be used on the full desktop web, allowing you to leverage a single library across all web environments.
