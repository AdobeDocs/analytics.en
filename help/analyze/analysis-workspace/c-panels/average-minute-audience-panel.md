In Analysis Workspace, average minute audience is the time spent viewing your media stream divided by the duration of the content or the total selection of the period and selected granularity.

The Media average minute audience panel enables you to better understand average consumption of your content by comparing programs of any length or genre. For example, you can understand average consumption when comparing a 30-minute sitcom with a 3-hour sporting event.

In addition, you can use the Media average minute audience panel to compare or append this digital average minute audience to linear TV average minute metrics. 

The Media average minute audience panel provides the following benefits over the Average Minute Audience metric:

* Supports custom time periods

* Allows for updating the duration classification after views are processed

## Access the Media average minute audience panel

1. In Analysis Workspace, go to a report suite that has Media Analytics components enabled. 

1. In the left nav, select the **Panels** icon.

If a date range and granularity combination results in more than 1440 rows, the granularity is automatically updated to accommodate the full date range. |
   | [!UICONTROL **Drop a segment here (or any other component)**] | Like other panels, this setting filters your selections based on segments you've created. This is a great way to look at specific platforms, live streams, or other common media segments. |

If the duration is unavailable, or if you want to view the average minute audience for a time series with multiple pieces of content or content without a specific assigned duration (like during a live stream or event), then you should select [!UICONTROL **Custom time period**]. (Durations can be set using Classifications either before or after processing time.)</li><li>**Custom time period:** This is available regardless of whether the durations is made available using Classifications.</li></ul> <p>This setting changes the workflow and report output.</p>  |
