# Implement with Launch overview

Through the lifetime of Adobe Analytics, Adobe has offered several different methods to implement code on your site for data collection. Adobe's current recommend method is through Adobe Experience Platform Launch.

Launch is a tag management solution that lets you deploy Analytics code alongside other tagging requirements. Adobe offers integrations with other solutions and products, and lets you deploy custom code. All of these tasks can be done without relying on any development teams in your organization to update code on your site.

All customers with an active Adobe Experience Cloud contract can use Launch. If you are not sure if you have access, contact one of your organization's Experience Cloud system admins.

## Overall workflow

Getting an implementation running using Launch follows these steps:

1. **Gain access to Launch**: You can obtain access to Launch through a system admin in your organization.
2. **Create a property**: Properties are overarching containers used to reference tag management data.
3. **Deploy to a development environment**: Have an environment where you can iterate on the development of tags.
4. **Validate and publish to production**: Make sure everything is working, then publish it live.

See [Create an Analytics property in Adobe Experience Platform Launch](create-analytics-property.md) to get started.
