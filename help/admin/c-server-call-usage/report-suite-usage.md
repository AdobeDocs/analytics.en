# View report suite usage

The Report Suite Usage tab provides server usage data for each report suite in all Login companies tied to your Billing company, for the current usage period.

**[!UICONTROL Analytics]** > **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Server Call Usage]** > **[!UICONTROL Report Suite Usage]**

>If a report suite is not [linked to an Experience Cloud Organization](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/report-suite-mapping.html), its usage data will not be reflected in this dashboard. Also, a billing ID could be tied to multiple Experience Cloud Orgs; there is not always a 1:1 relationship between an org and a billing ID.

The Report Suite Usage dashboard

* Shows the current usage period's server call usage (All Calls, Primary, Secondary, Mobile Primary, Mobile Secondary) for each report suite in your Experience Cloud organization.
* Shows percentage of overall usage per server call category.
* Is updated daily.
* Is downloadable.
* Lets you access the **[!UICONTROL Manage Alerts]** UI.
