# Transfer user assets or set account expirations

Most user and product management functions have moved to the [Adobe Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-console.html). (To get started managing user permissions for Adobe Analytics users, see [Analytics in the Adobe Admin Console](/help/admin/admin-console/home.md).) 

While most user and product management functions are now available only in the Adobe Admin Console, the administrative functions described on this page are available only from the Adobe Analytics Admin area.
