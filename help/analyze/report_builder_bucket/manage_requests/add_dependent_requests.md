<a id="section_D6725B6C432C400FB08CF4A0D527538E"></a>

For reports with correlation breakdowns enabled within the report table, you can take a closer look at an item by right-clicking in the cell and clicking ** [!UICONTROL  Add Dependent Request] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  Breakdown] **. 
>[!NOTE]
>
>You can also add breakdown request while creating the original request. See[ Create a Data Request](../../report_builder_bucket/data_requests/t_create_a_data_request.md#task_65B453C8F015429A8EA73A1B64025B6C). 



>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Report Builder enforces request dependencies only within the same worksheet, not across worksheets. Restricting to dependencies within a single worksheet ensures timeliness of execution.
