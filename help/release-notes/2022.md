### Important notices for Adobe Analytics administrators

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **Update to new NetAcuity carrier database** | September 26, 2022 | This update, originally planned for on October 5, 2022, has been postponed to **January, 2023**. Carrier-related information stored in the `carrier` field in Adobe Analytics Data Warehouse and Analytics Data Feeds will change. Historically, the data format in that column has been `<domain>:<ISP>`. Adobe has maintained an internal lookup table to map these `<domain>:<ISP>` values into carrier names for reporting purposes in Adobe Analytics reporting tools (Analysis Workspace, Reports & Analytics, reporting API, Data Warehouse, LiveStream, etc.). The lookup file (`carrier.tsv`) is also provided with Data Feeds so that you can use the same mappings.<p>This update enhances our carrier mappings by using a more accurate carrier database from NetAcuity. The format of the data in the carrier column in Data Feeds will change going forward. Instead of `<domain>:<ISP>`, it will contain a carrier name. Adobe will continue to use the lookup table in order to maintain as much continuity with past reporting as possible. Reporting tools where the lookups are applied by Adobe (Analysis Workspace, Reports & Analytics, reporting API, data warehouse, LiveStream, etc.) will benefit from more accurate mappings. Some mappings – especially for international domains and ISPs – will change more than others when Adobe adopts the new database. The data feeds carrier lookup file (`carrier.tsv`) will maintain the old mappings and add the new mappings.<p>The Analytics Source Connector does not currently map the carrier field, so carrier reporting is not currently available in Experience Platform, CJA etc. Therefore, use of the new carrier database will not impact anything in Experience Platform that is based on data provided by the Analytics Source Connector. |
| **Improved IP-to-geolocation mapping** | September 26, 2022 | Our vendor for IP lookups, Digital Element, is upgrading to a new improved dataset (NetAcuity Pulse) for IP-to-geolocation mapping. Originally planned for October 2022, Adobe Analytics will adopt this new dataset in **January, 2023**. The new database will be more accurate than previous versions. Some IP-to-geo mappings will change/improve when the new database is adopted.<p>All Adobe Analytics tools (Analysis Workspace, Reports & Analytics, reporting API, data warehouse, LiveStream, data feeds etc.) will automatically take advantage of the new improved mappings. There will be no change in the format of the data in data feeds. CJA data provided through the Analytics Source Connector will also automatically take advantage of the new mappings. |
| **SFTP upgrade** | September 19, 2022 | Previously, Adobe had communicated that Adobe would upgrade its Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) services in September 2022 to provide improved security for file transfer. Adobe performed this upgrade on **September 20, 2022**. When this change took place, certain SFTP client configurations were no longer supported. This impacts only data sent to or retrieved from Adobe Analytics using SFTP. The FTP protocol is not impacted. In order to avoid service disruptions, please ensure that your SFTP clients (code, tools, services) are in accordance with the changes detailed [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/export/ftp-and-sftp/secure-file-transfer-protocol/sftp-upgrade.html). |
| **Changes to how Analytics handles A4T data collected via Experience Edge** | September 14, 2022 | In March 2022, Analytics changed how it handles some calls originating from Experience Edge that include A4T data. Hits with A4T reporting content are modified so that they are not treated as Page View (`t()`) or Link Tracking (`tl()`) events. This logic is now updated to include cases where `propositionDisplay` events were not being modified as intended. |
| **Automatic delimiters for list variables and list props in the Web SDK** | September 14, 2022 | List variables and list props now use the delimiters specified in report suite settings, unless a delimiter override is specified in XDM. See the [list](/help/implement/vars/page-vars/list.md) variable for more information. |
| **EOL for Data Workbench** | September 14, 2022 | Adobe intends to end-of-life Data Workbench effective **December 31, 2023**. Please contact your Customer Care representative for alternative solutions to Data Workbench of if you have any questions. |
| **Update to device lookups due to Google Client Hints** | August 19, 2022 | Starting on **October 26, 2022**, Adobe will begin using client hints in addition to the User-Agent when deriving certain device information for hits coming from Chromium browsers, such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. This is in response to Google's plan to gradually reduce the information presented from the User-Agent string in lieu of data passed via client hints. Read more about client hints [here](https://web.dev/user-agent-client-hints/).<p> By October, both the AppMeasurement and Web SDK collection libraries will support collection of client hints and configuring whether to high-entropy client hints are collected. As part of this change, Adobe will use Device Atlas for all device lookups related to User-Agent. Currently, Device Atlas is used only for mobile hits. These updates may result in small changes to device information historically derived from User-Agent - specifically Browser, Browser Type, Operating System, Operating System Type, and Mobile Device. [Learn more](/help/technotes/client-hints.md)|
| **Pausing scheduled reports in Reports & Analytics** | June 8, 2022 | On April 21, 2022, Adobe announced the deprecation of several features specific to scheduled reports in preparation for the previously announced end of life for Reports & Analytics. These features included the ability to schedule new reports as well as new data extracts.<p>In response to customer requests seeking an extension and to ease the transition from Reports & Analytics, Adobe has decided to extend access to these features until **Jan 31, 2023**. Please note that expiration windows for both reports and data extracts will continue to be limited to nine months; report and data extract delivery will pause at the end of this period unless the schedule is reactivated.<p>To reiterate, these features will be deprecated on January 31, 2023. Before this date, you must migrate your scheduled reporting to one of the other mechanisms available to you in Adobe Analytics. For additional questions or support, please reach out to Adobe Customer Care. [Learn more](/help/analyze/reports-analytics/scheduled-reports-eol.md) |
| **Pausing scheduled tasks in Report Builder** | June 8, 2022 | On April 21, 2022, Adobe rolled out changes to scheduled tasks in Report Builder as part of our performance and delivery optimization efforts. These changes included removing the ability to have scheduled deliveries "end after x occurrences." In response to several customer requests seeking more time to explore and implement alternatives, Adobe has decided to restore this option in a limited fashion until **Jan 31, 2023**.<p>You can continue to schedule hourly Report Builder tasks and have them end after a maximum of 99 occurrences. Please note that the rollback only applies to hourly tasks; the "end after x occurrences" will remain unavailable for all other delivery intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly). Please note that this option will be deprecated on January 31, 2023. For more questions or support, please reach out to Adobe Customer Care. [Learn more](/help/analyze/report-builder/r-arb-scheduled-reports.md)|
| **EOL for [!DNL Reports & Analytics]** | January 4, 2022 | Effective **December 31, 2023**, Adobe intends to discontinue [!DNL Reports & Analytics] and its accompanying reports and features. The reports, visualizations, and underlying technology that power [!DNL Reports & Analytics] no longer meet Adobe's technology standards. Most [!DNL Reports & Analytics] features are available in [Analysis Workspace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.html). Since the release of Analysis Workspace in 2015, [!DNL Reports & Analytics] functionality and capabilities have been moved to Analysis Workspace and a threshold of workflow parity has been reached. [This notice](https://spark.adobe.com/page/6WnF8JK6IRDhf/) explains the end-of-life process. |

| **Pausing scheduled reports in Reports & Analytics** | June 8, 2022 | On April 21, 2022, we announced the deprecation of several features specific to scheduled reports in preparation for the previously announced end of life for Reports & Analytics. These features included the ability to schedule new reports as well as new data extracts.<p>In response to customer requests seeking an extension and to ease the transition from Reports and Analytics, we have decided to extend access to these features until **Jan 31, 2023**. Please note that expiration windows for both reports and data extracts will continue to be limited to nine months; report and data extract delivery will pause at the end of this period unless the schedule is reactivated.<p>To reiterate, these features will be deprecated on January 31, 2023. Before this date, you must migrate your scheduled reporting to one of the other mechanisms available to you in Adobe Analytics.

| **Pausing scheduled tasks in Report Builder** | June 8, 2022 | On April 21, 2022, we rolled out changes to scheduled tasks in Report Builder as part of our performance and delivery optimization efforts. These changes included removing the ability to have scheduled deliveries "end after x occurrences." In response to several customer requests seeking more time to explore and implement alternatives, we have decided to restore this option in a limited fashion until **Jan 31, 2023**.<p>You can continue to schedule hourly Report Builder tasks and have them end after a maximum of 99 occurrences. Please note that the rollback only applies to hourly tasks; the "end after x occurrences" will remain unavailable for all other delivery intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly). Please note that this option will be deprecated on January 31, 2023. For more questions or support, please reach out to Adobe Customer Care.

### Fixes in Adobe Analytics

* Fixed an issue in Data Feeds, where the Start and End Dates changed automatically after saving the Data Feed when creating from Data Feed UI. The dates were updating themselves by 1 day. (AN-281262)
* Fixed an issue that prevented the renewal of scheduled projects via e-mail link. (AN-283622)
* Fixed an issue that caused recent releases of Apple Safari and Microsoft Edge to not be correctly identified in Adobe's browser type lookup table. Similar to when [browser versions are updated](/help/components/dimensions/browser.md), updates to browser type lookup tables only correct data moving forward. The lookup tables for browser version were updated on April 20, and the lookup tables for browser type were updated on April 28. (AN-284872; AN-285753; AN-286257)

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Older scheduled reports paused  | March 11, 2022 | Effective **April 15, 2022**, Adobe intends to pause all scheduled reports that have a creation date greater than two years (created before January 31, 2020). No reports or data will be deleted. Only reports identified as older than two years will be paused, and no additional scheduled reports will be sent. |
| 2022 ISO region updates | March 11, 2021 | Adobe will perform 2022 ISO region updates on **June 10, 2022**. Expect to see minor updates following this release. |
| Changing how Analytics handles A4T data collected via Experience Edge | February 25, 2022 | On **March 7th, 2022**, we will change how we handle some Target-related data sent to Adobe Analytics via Experience Edge. When using the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK with Analytics and Target, some personalization events were counted in [!DNL Adobe Analytics] as [!UICONTROL Page Views]. This led to inflated page view counts and additional server calls. With the change, personalization calls with no Analytics content will be disregarded.
