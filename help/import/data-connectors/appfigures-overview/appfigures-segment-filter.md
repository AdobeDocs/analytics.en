# Segmenting App Data{#segmenting-app-data}

An appFigures integration is often used to collect data for multiple applications across multiple app stores. You can create segments to isolate report data for a specific app or app store.

Segmentation guidelines for appFigures data:

* Must use page view containers only.
* Must use only [AppFigures dimensions](../appfigures-overview/appfigures-metrics.md) in filtering rules.
* Can use multiple segment rules as long as only [AppFigures dimensions](../appfigures-overview/appfigures-metrics.md#concept-890b06e6f59e44a7a331ce872f4e1d9c) are referenced.
* Can use both the Include and Exclude canvas.
* Segments apply only to Adobe Analytics v15.
