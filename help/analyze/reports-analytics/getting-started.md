# Get started with Reports & Analytics

Before using Reports & Analytics, understand these basic login and setup tasks, and how to access account information.

Reporting provides insights into your traditional web-based channels as well as evolving channels like mobile, video, and social networking. Some examples of reports include:

* How many people visit your site 
* How many of those visitors are unique visitors (counted only once) 
* How they came to the site (such as whether they followed a link or came there directly) 
* What keywords visitors used to search site content 
* How long visitors stayed on a given page or on the entire site 
* What links visitors clicked, and when they left the site 
* Which marketing channels are most effective at generating revenue or conversion events 
* How much time they spent watching a video 
* Which browsers and devices they used to visit your site
