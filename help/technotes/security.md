Information on practices specific to Adobe Analytics is found in the [Adobe Analytics security overview](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/trust-center/ungated/whitepapers/experience-cloud/adb-analytics-security-wp.pdf). It outlines the processes followed around architecture, authentication, data centers, network, and personnel.
