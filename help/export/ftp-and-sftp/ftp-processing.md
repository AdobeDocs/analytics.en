# FTP processing times

Processing time for any FTP file, whether for classifications or Data Sources, is based on the number of files already in the processing queue and the size of your file.

If the file you submit is larger than 5MB, you may experience slightly longer import times. If you do not see your completed file in your FTP site after 1-2 days, but you do not see the uploaded data reflected in reporting tools, your organization's supported users should contact Adobe Customer Care to determine whether there was an issue with the file.

Be sure to add the notification recipient's email address when you create your FTP file. That way most issues result in a notification being sent to the recipient.
