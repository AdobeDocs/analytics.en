| **Update to device lookups due to Google Client Hints** | February 27, 2023 | The use of client hints, planned for February 16, 2023, was postponed in order to better ensure the quality of device lookups using hints.

| **Automatic migration to Classification Set architecture** | February 8, 2023 | Over the next several months, Adobe plans to migrate all classifications across all organizations to the latest classification architecture. The last customers to migrate is estimated to happen in May 2023. No customer action is required, and no down time is expected. This new architecture has many benefits, including:<ul><li>Significantly reduced processing time (72 hours â†’ 24 hours)</li><li>The ability to use the [Classification Sets](/help/components/classifications/sets/overview.md) UI</li><li>The option to use classification data in Adobe Experience Platform in the future through the [Adobe Analytics source connector for classification data](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sources/connectors/adobe-applications/classifications.html)</li></ul>Note the following changes that can potentially impact your organization's workflow:<ul><li>When using the browser or FTP import, '[!UICONTROL Overwrite on conflict]' is always enabled.</li><li>When using the browser or FTP import, the option to export immediately after import is no longer supported.</li><li>The Analytics 2.0 API `GetDimensions` endpoint now returns string identifiers for classifications instead of numeric identifiers. Numeric identifiers can still be used, but Adobe recommends using the new string identifiers where possible. Numeric identifiers can be retrieved by using the `?expansion=hidden` query string parameter.</li></ul>Contact Adobe Customer Care if you want a more specific migration schedule for your organization, or have questions/concerns around this migration.
