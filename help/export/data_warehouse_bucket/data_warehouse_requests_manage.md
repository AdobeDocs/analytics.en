# Manage Data Warehouse requests

In Data Warehouse, select the **[!UICONTROL  Request Manager]** tab. 

Working in this tab lets you 
* View recent report requests by report name, segment applied, requestor, request date and status.
* Duplicate requests. Click **[!UICONTROL  Duplicate]** next to the request. 
  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >This action duplicates only the request, not the schedule or the delivery details.

* Search for reports by report name or by the login name of the requestor.
* Re-prioritize reports by dragging and dropping them to a new location within the queue.
* To see when a request started processing, click on a scheduled request ID and examine the pop-up that opens.
