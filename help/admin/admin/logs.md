Log files to help you see when users log in, their usage, access, report suites, and Admin changes.

## Admin Log {#section_8ADE8A7204A8401C968ABC20AECA381D}

The admin log reports all changes made by administrators in admin tools. The log provides a gateway to user-defined reports from any of the three logs. You can search for events matching your selected criteria over a specified date range.

## Usage and Access Log {#section_6FBAF92D9EA244809C45A78A2F0A7232}

The [!UICONTROL Usage and Access Log] lets you evaluate report usage at the user account level. For example, it tracks open, create, update, unshare and delete actions in Analysis Workspace. This allows for better visibility into who is using Workspace, and how often.
