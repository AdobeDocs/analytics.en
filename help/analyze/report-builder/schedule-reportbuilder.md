# Schedule workbooks for sharing through email

>[!NOTE]
>
>In addition to scheduling workbooks for sharing through email, as described in this section, you can schedule workbooks to be exported to cloud destinations, as described in [Schedule workbooks for export to cloud destinations](/help/analyze/report-builder/report-builder-export.md).

After you saved your workbook and completed your analysis, you can easily share your workbook with others on your team using the scheduling feature. The Schedule feature allows you to create a schedule that automatically refreshes the data in the workbook and emails the Excel workbook .xlsx file as an attachment to your specified audience at a specific date and time. Setting up a schedule provides recipients with regular updates&ndash;automatically. You can also use the schedule feature to send out the workbook once without scheduling automatic updates.

You can create multiple schedules for a single workbook. For example, you can send a workbook to your team on a daily basis and you can send the workbook to your manager once a week by creating two different schedules.

The Schedule feature also allows you to set up password protection for a workbook and edit previously scheduled workbooks.

## Schedule a workbook

Use the Schedule button in the Report Builder hub to quickly create a schedule so that you can automatically distribute a workbook Excel file (.xlsx) to an individual or a group.

1. Click the Schedule button in the Report Builder hub.

    ![Click the Schedule button to create a schedule.](./assets/schedule-button.png){width="55%"}

1. Click Schedule Workbook or the plus button in the upper-left to create a new scheduled workbook.

    ![The Schedule workbooks window.](./assets/schedule-workbook.png){width="55%"}

    The scheduling pane displays some pre-defined information about the workbook such as the workbook name and the last date that the workbook was modified.

    ![The scheduling pane.](./assets/schedule-pane.png){width="55%"}

1. (Optional) Enter a file name.

    The workbook file name defaults to the name of the workbook but you can change this if you want. If you\'re sending the same workbook to multiple audiences and you want to name it something a little bit more friendly for a certain audience, you can change the name.

1. (Optional) Select **Append time-stamp to file name**.

    You can append a timestamp to the file name to identify the date the workbook was updated. This is helpful to quickly see which version of a workbook was sent on a specific date. The **Filename preview** shows how the workbook file name will appear in the email when the workbook is distributed. The time-stamp format is YYYY-MM-DD.

1. (Optional) Select **.zip compression** to compress the file and set up password protection on the file.

    When you make this selection, you're prompted to enter a password to open the file. This is helpful if you have concerns about data security and you want to password protect the workbook. Protecting the file with a password requires you to select **.zip compression**. The password must be at least 8 characters and contain a number and a special character.

    ![Enter a password in the Password protect the workbook field.](./assets/zip-compression.png){width="55%"}

1. Enter **Recipients**. You can enter the name of a person that is recognized in your organization, or you can enter an email address of a person inside or outside of your organization.

1. Enter the **Subject** of the email and a description for your recipients. The subject defaults to the workbook file name but you can modify the subject if needed. You can add details in the description section.

    ![Enter a subject in the Subject field.](./assets/recipients-subject.png){width="55%"}

1. Set up the scheduling options to set the date and time that you want the workbook emailed to your recipients.

    Choose the start and end date and time frames. This can be today's date or a date in the future.

    Choose the **Frequency** from the drop-down menu. You can set the frequency to be hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly on a specific day. For example, you can set up a schedule to send the workbook on the first Sunday night of the month so that your recipients will have the email in their inbox first thing on Monday morning.

    ![Select the frequency to schedule your report.](./assets/frequency.png){width="55%"}

1. After you set the schedule, click **Send on schedule**.

    ![Click Send on schedule.](./assets/send-on-schedule.png){width="55%"}

    You see a confirmation toast at the bottom of the Report Builder hub and the scheduled workbook is listed under the Workbooks tab.

    ![Confirmation toast](./assets/confirmation-toast.png){width="55%"}

## Schedule a converted workbook {#converted}

1. Schedule a [converted](/help/analyze/report-builder/convert-workbooks.md) legacy workbook.

   A pop up appears, asking if you want to use the scheduling metada from the legacy workbook to create a new scheduled task. 

1. If you select **[!UICONTROL Use]**, Report Builder automatically fills in the legacy scheduling information. 

1. Ensure that this information is correct and schedule. 

1. If you want to send the workbook on a different schedule, schedule a completely fresh scheduled task. 


## Send the workbook one-time only

You can also send out the workbook only once.

1. Un-check **Show scheduling options** 

    ![Click Un-check Show scheduling options to send out a workbook one time.](./assets/send-now.png){width="40%"}

1. Click **Send Now**.
