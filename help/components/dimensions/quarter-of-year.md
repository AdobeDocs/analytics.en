# Quarter of year

The 'Quarter of year' dimension reports the quarter of any given year as a dimension item. This report is valuable if you want a report broken out by the quarter of the year, but do not want a static date as dimension items. You can aggregate year-over-year reports by quarter, so Q1 data of this year aggregates with Q1 data from last year in the same dimension item.

## Populate this dimension with data

This dimension works out of the box for all implementations. If a report suite contains data, this dimension works.

## Dimension items

Dimension items include numeric quarters of the year (`1` to `4`), representing the quarter of the year that the hit occurred on.
