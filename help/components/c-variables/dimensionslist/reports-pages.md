# Pages

Ranks the pages on your site based on the pages that receive the most traffic. If your business question deals with quantitative data for pages, you can use this report to answer that question, by adding the right metrics.

## Allocation, Expiration, and Special Values {#section_4D8CE5E111DD48FBBDCF9B5A1F16E92E}

Note that in Reports & Analytics, metrics on the Pages Report use linear allocation. For example, revenue is split between all pages viewed before a purchase event. This can cause confusion for some metrics that you might expect to occur only on one page, such as a shopping cart addition.

In Reports & Analytics, if you apply any custom event as metric in a Pages report, linear allocation applies.

This means that even if the event was sent with an s.tl() call, it will get the linear allocation of any previous s.t() call. Example:

|  Page Name  | Page_event  | Events  |
|---|---|---|
|  Page1  |**s.t()** |  |
|  Page1  | s.tl()  | Event1  |
|  Page1  | s.tl()  | Event1  |
|  Page1  | s.tl()  | Event1  |
|  Page2  |**s.t()** |  |
|  Page2  |**s.t()** |  |
|  Page2  | s.tl()  | Event1  |

For this scenario, we will obtain the following allocation in the Pages report:

|  Pages  | Pageviews  | Event 1  |
|---|---|---|
|  Page 1  | 1  | 1+1+1+1/3 = 3.33  |
|  Page 2  | 2  | 2/3 = 0.67  |

Even if the event is sent on an s.tl call, the page viewed prior to the event that was sent (s.t() call) will get partial credit.

## Notes {#section_47B0F4746D4847AC9E8697127063F4D0}

* If no page name exists, the URL is used.
* If you have a hit with no page name, page URL, or event list (no commerce event), the hit is excluded.
* Breakdowns on pages show all pages that had a value persisted.
