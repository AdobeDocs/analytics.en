# Classifications overview

A classification is a way of categorizing Analytics variable data, then displaying the data in different ways when you generate reports. You establish a relationship between a variable value and metadata related to that value. Classifications can be used on most custom dimensions, such as Tracking Code, props, and eVars.

Adobe offers multiple ways to classify data. All classification data operates the same in reporting, and you can combine any of these methods that best fits your organization. Each classification method provides their own advantages.

* **Classification Sets**: Create and manage classifications and their rules in a single, simplified interface.
* **Classification Rules**: Create rules that assign a given dimension item to a classification dimension item. This method to classify data is best when a dimension frequently encounters new unique values or where manual classification would be frequent and burdensome.
* **Classification Importer**: Export a template spreadsheet with dimension items in each row. Columns represent each classification for a dimension. This method to classify data is best when all dimension items are known and does not require frequent updating.

Once a dimension contains classification data, a new dimension is available in reporting that contains only classification dimension items. For example, you can classify [!UICONTROL Product IDs] with additional product attributes, such as product name, color, size, description, and SKU. Augmenting reporting and analytics data with additional attributes provides deeper and more complex reporting opportunities.

A single dimension can utilize multiple classification dimensions. For example, you can classify Tracking Code by Search Engine, Keyword, and Campaign Channel.
