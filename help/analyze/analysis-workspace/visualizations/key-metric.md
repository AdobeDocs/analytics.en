# Key metric summary

The Key Metric Summary visualization lets you see how an important metric is trending within a single timeframe. It also lets you compare metric performance across two timeframes. It provides the benefits of multiple visualizations combined into one visualization:

* **[!UICONTROL Line]** visualizations that shows how the metric is trending for the primary and comparison date ranges

* **[!UICONTROL Summary percent change]** that shows the metric increase or decrease between the primary and comparison date ranges

* Current total value ([!UICONTROL **summary number**]) for the metric

## Use cases

This visualization addresses a variety of common use cases, including:

* An analyst trying to understand how opportunity creation looked this month compared to the same timeframe last year. 

* A marketer exploring how lead generation for a specific lead type has changed from this month to last month.

* An executive wanting to understand how new bookings changed from this quarter to last quarter.

## Configure the Key metric summary

1. Drag the **[!UICONTROL Key metric summary]** visualization from the **[!UICONTROL Visualizations]** menu in the left rail into a panel.

1. Configure the visualization by selecting a metric, a primary date range, and a comparison date range and a segment (if desired):

   | Configuration setting | Definition |
   | --- | --- |
   | **[!UICONTROL Metric]** | Select the metric you want to examine. All metrics are supported. |
   | **[!UICONTROL Primary date range]** | The current date range for the freeform table.  |
   | **[!UICONTROL Comparison date range]** | The date range to which you want to compare the primary date range. |
   | **[!UICONTROL Segment (optional)]** | Any segment that you are specifically interested in for this summary.  |

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Build]**.

## View the output

Please note:

* The **[!UICONTROL Previous period]** line graph (always displayed in grey) corresponds to the **[!UICONTROL Comparison date range]** in the configuration step.

* If a comparison date range is not selected during configuration or is hidden in the visualization settings (more on settings below), only the line graph for the primary date range is displayed. The summary change will be hidden. 

* From here, you can hover over the line graphs to see the statistics for individual days:

## Settings

The Key metric summary offers multiple flexible settings to enable better reporting and communication of important metrics. Settings can be accessed through the cog in top right-hand corner of the visualization.
