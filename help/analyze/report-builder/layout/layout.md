# Layout - Request Wizard Step 2

The Request Wizard: Step 2 window lets you configure the report layout, header formatting, and dimension filtering for output. You can use a Pivot Layout to configure the request, which is similar how you create an Excel pivot table.

Alternatively, you can manually select the cells in which you want to display report data by using the [Custom Layout](../../report-builder/layout/configure-the-custom-layout.md#concept_F711B12D6BE74F4880E5F596C2848183).
